-Fixed the wand explosion bug AGAIN...typo broke the code again...(zap.c)
-only forced rehumanization should result in possible HP loss via exhaustion
	ie dopps should be able to consciously revert without substantial HP loss
	?? make this proportional? Cause hpbase burn ALWAYS on forced rehum?
-You as wax, straw, paper golems will burn (instead of rot) when hit by fire attacks.
	(msg error)

	susceptible attack. (mhitu.c)

        - you can't extend claws when 'L' and polymorphed.  Think of it
        as needing your "human" bone structure. (cmd.c)
        -retract claws when swapping to a weapon. (wield.c)
        -message is now "fingernails extending to claws"
                Thanks Ben Newall (ben@eki.com) (cmd.c)
-In #enhance skills menu - will keep calling the menu if you can enhance
        more than one skill. Saw a comment at the top and implemented it.
        (weapon.c)
-Added "yell"  preceding successful megafireball cast.  "Kamehameha" for
        magic missile,  "Shinkuu Hadouken" for fireball and
        "Gessho Suityaha" for cone of cold. (Now, where could these
        have come from.  Haven't been playing SF vs Xmen/Samurai Shodown ;B )
        (zap.c) Actually, I wouldn't mind more
        appropriate "yells" (esp for cone of cold). Feel free to submit.
-In Wizard MODE: can now advance skills without practice.  For debugging
        the fireballs (Yeah right ;B) #enhance will now prompt for whether
        you want to advance skills without practice. (weapon.c)

ver 0.0.2E6 [Dec/09/97]
-fixed the wand of fireball zapping green.  It should now be a more "normal"
        red. (zap.c)
-Added a magenta magical explosion.  Note that the cold explosion,  magical
        explosions are also visible as different colored ASCII characters
        for those of you who use colored IBM char set.  If you use b&w,
        this won't change much. (explode.c,  rm.h, drawing.c)
-fixed some silly glyph things: whenever a shield glpyh/tile came on
        during an explosion,  Nethack would replace it with a normal
        explosion glyph - even if it was a cold explosion.  (explode.c)
-Added Mega Magic Missile/Fireball/Cone of cold:
                For those who complain that spells
        just aren't powerful enough,  here's the spells for you.  When
        a wizard is skilled in matter spells, he will no longer cast
        wimpy wandlike bolts of fire/cold/magic missiles.  
        He will fire a blast 3 times as large and 3x as strong.
        These are powerful spells - do not play with these!
        --As a technical note, what I've done is taken a standard
                fire/cold bolt/magmissile and caused it to explode
                every step of the way...
        (spell.c, zap.c, explode.c)
        As a matter of note,  I hope to add "enhanced" versions of all the
        spells,  but I wouldn't mind any suggestions.
        I'll probably put the old super fireball/cones in as spells.
-fixed the explosions...I had accidentally replaced the normal fire
        explosions with the cold explosion tiles. (other.txt)
-'L' now has a new special ability - slash!  Based loosely off Wolverine's
        Berserker Barrage (arcade ;B),  you have to be empty handed to use.
        When you attack your next enemy,  you will go into a similar state
        as when you go berserk,  except the enemy can't hit you back.
        Note that you have to land a hit before the barrage starts,  and
        while you're attacking,  you can still be hit by other monsters.
        If you wield a weapon,  you will retract your claws.
        (timeout.c, uhitm.c, cmd.c, wield.c)

-Changed version number to fit Nethack scheme (patchlev.h)
-fixed keys in dos help file  - added/fixed alt keys for quit,
        skills, class effects(msdoshlp.txt) (you may need to delete nhdat

|Section 2.0 Storytime|
+---------------------+

The tale of Nethack and I really doesn't go too far back.  I remember
downloading an old version of Nethack off some BBS way back in my early
high school years.  Played it a couple times,  was wiped out really fast
most of the time.  Made it to the Gnomish mines.  Must have been 3.1.3.
Ran into Alphaman and a couple other roguelikes.  Got deleted sometime.

Early in Grade 11,  I was poking around and I stumbled upon BW's (no,
I'm not going to spell it wrong ;B) Nethack pages.  Found 3.2.2,  and
played it for a while.  Good fun,  and the tiles let me know at a glance
I was pounding away at,  but I was playing around with QuakeC,  so I
figured I may as well put my little install of DJGPP to good use.
Downloaded the sources,  figured out how to fix the DOS makefile.  Made
one change,  got bored,  and it got lost the next time my HD needed
pruning.

Sometime at the beginning of 1997 (my graduating year),  I ran into
Nethack again.  BW's page was still standing,  and I got the game and
the source.  Ran amok a couple links,  and came across Darren Hebden's
Roguelike News page.  Was reading some news items,  and thought to
myself

"Hey!  How come it's all this Angband stuff?   I can't even stand
playing Angband for more than 30 seconds. (Must have been that runin
with the room filled with lice).  Where's the Nethack mods?"

So with a little poking around,  I came across SLASH V6 4.1.2E8 and the
Wizard Patch.  They both looked neat.  I wanted both.

Correction.  I wanted both,  AND I wanted myself on the news page.
Phew!  Finally got that off my conscience.  Yes,  this labour of love
was also spurred by an odd initial self-centered desire to get some
fame.

So I made SLASH'EM.  Actually,  I tried patching the Wizard Patch onto
the SLASH ported to Nethack 3.2.2 source.  Failure.  Sources were too
different.  About a hundred incompatible chunks.  Gave up,  and put it
away.  Then,  one strange night,  I was REALLY BORED.  So I did the
patch by hand.  By the end of it,  I was almost 100% sure it would
explode.

I had to fix a couple typos.  It compiled.  It ran.  SLASH'EM was born.
This was probably where SLASH'EM probably would have died.  With an
incredible dash of luck,  it all somehow worked.  Despite the fact the
two weren't designed to mix.  Despite the fact that I'd never done C
programming before.

Yes.  Nethack was actually my pounding block for learning the C programming
language.  Scary,  neh?  I learned a lot.  Not much terminology - but it's
come to the point that most things work all right.  New features
actually being implemented.  For those wondering, before Nethack and real C,
I did BASIC programming (various versions)  and some QuakeC.  

Not too long after,  I was actually adding features.  Original
stuff.  Spur of the moment additions.  Bug fixes.

Sometimes,  things were touch and go.  There was the time I was trying to
add light sourced spells.  That was supposed to be a couple hours.
I broke the entire zap code.  But the thing is - if I'm halfway in,  I'll
generally finish the job.  Just because it would be a waste of my time if
I gave up.

Then,  somewhere along the way,  other people actually played it.  I
started getting bug reports.  People actually saying good things.  People
telling me every other version that yes - the boulder bug is back ;B

Actually,  if it hadn't been for the fact I'd get a message every week
or so from someone different telling me about some bug,  thanking me for
making the game,  this probably would have died eons ago.  The SLASH'EM
page gets tons more hits than my actual personal webpage ;B

It taught me C programming.  It taught me that there is actually a
community of people out there who are awfully nice,  even though half a
dozen posts a week to their message board concern computer hacking.

I'm now a 2nd year university student at the University of British
Columbia.  Looks like I'm going to do an Honours in Microbiology -
Immunology Option.  Haven't ever taken a computer course yet,  although
I plan on doing the 1st year Compsci courses this summer.  I play
SLASH'EM in the time I should probably be studying and doing homework.
I've never gotten to Medusa,  let alone ascended,  without using Wizard
mode.

Anyhow,  this ended up awfully longwinded and probably very boring.  But
hopefully,  this'll encourage anybody with their little Nethack dream to
never stop suggesting their ideas,  or going out and making their
patch.  It could happen.

Plus,  now you know why every other SLASH'EM version crashes terribly :B

Happy Hacking!
