Read the Guidebook for a general description of what Slash'EM is and how to play.  Unfortunately, the Guidebook is > 32K, so you will need something other than SimpleText to view it.  Edit the file Slash'EM Defaults in this directory to modify startup options.  Feel free to turn off News when you get tired of seeing its message when you start up.
