"Climate protection? Bah! We shouldn't waste our time with that!",
"Vote for my party or I'll send some assassins to snipe you on the way to the voting office!",
"They call me a demagogue just because I don't blindly repeat the government's opinion! That's bullshit, and everyone who uses their brain should know that!",
"The politicians are making changes just for the sake of making them, not because those changes would actually be good for the people!",
"I know for a fact that lawmakers are paid for the amount of changes they make, not for quality. That's why they keep making stupid laws.",
"I think that taxes are really just legalized theft, and I want to abolish the thieving government that keeps taking my well-earned money!",
"The current political system is a dictatorship! We need to get rid of the dictator and have anarchy instead, then everything will get better!",
"We need to build a giant wall around our country!",

"The leader of our country got in charge due to collusion, and should be imprisoned!",
"Hopefully another country decides to invade ours and kill our political leaders, because we'd be better off without them.",
"We finally want another WAR! After all, 'peace' just means the government oppresses their people, while if there were war, we could at least TRY to fight for a better future!",
"In the so-called 'democracy', the people in charge tolerate all opinions - except the ones that contradict their own! How is that 'democratic', I ask you?",
"Politics is for the butthole! What we need is complete anarchy!",
"Why are our people listening to the drivel spouted by our 'leader'? We're mature citizens, and we don't need no one telling us what to do!",

"We shall ban ALL discrimination that targets a person's sexuality! You should be allowed to love whoever you want!",
"Anti-discrimination laws shouldn't be a one-way street! Both those who agree with the government's party line and those who don't should be protected from discrimination!",
"Politicians are the anti-fun squad! They only ever make laws that ban people from having fun, and therefore all those laws should be abolished ASAP!",
"Why is our police so corrupt? If I were president, they'd be honorable lawful citizens that cannot be bribed by any ass criminal!",

"God shall protect our people! God shall protect our country!",
"Our courageous soldiers have one mission: bringing back peace and prosperity to our country.",

"They're either with us or against us! And those who are against us, they shall tremble and quake in fear before I execute them!",
"Our country used to be a 'democracy', but lately it has quickly drifted off into a dictatorship! We must remove the evil dictator!",
"I will not forgive the government for erecting a dictatorship!",
"This banana republic goes before the dogs!",
"Napoleon was wrong when he said that people are stupid, because the truth would be that people are SUPER stupid!",
"Einstein said that the world's population is increasing, and with that I agree. But I disagree that according to him the amount of intelligence is a constant; in reality, the amount of intelligence is decreasing!",
"When looking at the results of the last election, I have to conclude that the majority of people aren't actually members of the 'homo sapiens' species. They're more like 'homo stultus'.",
"The government does a damage have!",
"This government has a total damage. I wish someone would go and stop the muck chaps.",

"We may not consume the state-regulated media, because they are fake news!",
"All the newspapers are spreading fake news!",
"Too many disturbing elements are showering our people with alternative facts and we have to remove those evil perpetrators for good.",
"The current president is not my president! That unscrupulous person gained his title by cheating and therefore needs to be usurped!",
"Goddamn politicians! They're responsible for all the evil in this world!",
"Down with the government! Anarchy is the only way to victory!",
"This country belongs to the people and no shitting law is gonna change that!",
"Laws are there so that one does not obey them! Better yet, they should be abolished completely, which will free our people from their imaginary shackles!",
"Freedom of religion is stupid! If I become the head of state, I'll ensure that the only entity you are allowed to worship is gonna be me!",
"The first rule of corona is that you don't talk about corona.",
"Democracy is a misconception, it sounds nice on paper but doesn't work out in practice!",
"In an ideal world everyone would be able to wear high heels, regardless of gender! Stop the discrimination now!",
"If I want to wear a bra, I should damn well be allowed to do so! And I don't care if I'm a man, woman, dog, bear or attack helicopter! FUCK DISCRIMINATION",
"Morgellons are little worms that live in FFP-2 masks, placed there by the evil manufacturers to infiltrate and eat the wearer's brain. They also don't really exist, but are nonetheless very annoying!",
"Humankind is just so stupid! If they were a bit smarter, maybe we would get somewhere!",
"Democracy is a fallacy! Democracy means that a committee of STUPID people make silly decisions against the will of smart citizens like me!",
"People are so stupid! They do everything the government wants! In fact, they are so mindlessly obedient, the government could force them to step into dog shit once per day and clean their shoes by hand, and people would actually do that without asking questions.",
"Humankind has failed. In the future, the predominant species on this planet will not be the human, but the virus. And that's despite the fact that the virus isn't even a sentient being.",
"I give you a 3g certificate in your face bitch, in a democracy you could decide whether you want to be vaccinated but this country obviously isn't one.",
"The best way to cool down the planet is to launch a couple nukes. That will cause a nuclear winter, which reduces global temperature by several Kelvin. Oh, the nuclear fallout? Who cares about that, it's only the weak who will die to the radiation anyway.",
"The egemony of the powerful country has to be abolished, we want to ensure that smaller countries also have rights!", /* the word 'hegemony' is misspelled on purpose */
"The stupid sanctions are stupid, no country has ever budged just because a bunch of others placed sanctions on them!",
"Supplying weapons into war zones? Seriously??? What the hell is the government smoking?",
"If I were president, we'd not have a global hunger crisis! We'd still have good trade relationships with the countries that export wheat and sunflower oil!",
"They should let me run the country, I'd dictate that a liter of E10 fuel may never cost more than 1,50 euros and all gas stations that violate this rule will have to pay a monthly income as a punishment, with the threat of being shut down entirely if they step out of line again.",
"Man, why can't I be the god-emperor? I'd make sure that no people are used for heating if there is a war just because they have a penis, with me in charge everyone, man and woman alike, could decide for themselves whether they want to participate in a war or not! Freedom for everyone!",
"War... Can not these nations who wish to stain themselves with blood and flame recognize that an unimaginable crisis has befallen this world?", /* by Saimore (Elona), although he uses the name of the Elona world */
"Would you want to run to the front and get killed just because you have a cock? Yeah, me neither.",
"The clown uses all the cock carriers for heating, which is truly intolerable.",
"You can smoke all the politicians in the pipe, especially those from the party cartel.",
"The government should stop building cloud cook-cook homes and start doing some real politics!",
"The term 'lady shoes' is discriminatory, that's like saying men are unable to walk with that pair of shoes just because they have heels, despite high-heeled shoes originally being conceived as men's shoes. Which implies that in reality both genders can walk in heeled shoes just fine, so they should just be viewed as unisex and the gender attribute for shoes abolished.",

"Remember, you maggot: You may not train too many men! If you do it anyway I'll rake in your cash, and not just a little!",
"Remember, you maggot: You may not enhance too many skills! If you do it anyway I'll rake in your cash, and not just a little!",

"Never forget that my energy fields are buildings too and thereby are protected as well - woe to you if you break even one of them, then you are due!",
"Be very careful, you maggot. My private office is in some odd corner, and you'll pay plenty of money if you trespass.",
"Yeah, you maggot, there's my ore mines, but they're none of your business. Don't even think about mining them.",
"Don't get any stupid ideas unless you like fines.",
"Always stay in your assigned area and everything will be alright. But don't get the idea to invade my labs because you need to be wearing a lab coat for those!",
"Woe to you. If you do anything forbidden in my zone, you will regret it bitterly.",
"You may never get the idea to steal any relics, or it'll become very expensive. Additionally you may never try to convert my men because there's no freedom of religion here!",
"You may never get the idea to sacrifice corpses, or it'll become very expensive. Additionally you may never try to convert my altars because there's no freedom of religion here!",

"The construction of too many bunker facilities is likewise forbidden, and woe to you if you get the idea to convert my altars! Sitting idly is penalized too so better make sure you're working!",

"You maggot hopefully also always obey the rule that you may never have more money than me?",
"Don't be a coward that disguises as a tank - if you wear too much thick armor, you'll pay a fine!",
"If you dare disrupting my economy, I'll have your ass! Don't harm any shopkeepers or watchmen, capito?",
"Remember that any and all bodies of water are my property because I need them for my ships! You'd better not dare freezing my ponds!",
"You're a first-semester practicant! Always be aware that highly toxic substances are absolutely taboo for you - if I catch you handling them, I'll actually give you hall exclusion!",
"Using too much gunpowder is forbidden! If you break that rule, it'll get quite expensive!",
"I'm the only one who's allowed to be toting a heavy machine gun. Better hope I don't catch you trying to use one, for if I do...",
"You're of course not allowed to use unforgivable curses. If you do, the punishment will be... most unpleasant.",
"Always adhere to good laboratory practice and avoid explosions. Should I catch you trying to synthesize explosives, there'll be a fine that you have to pay.",
"Don't EVER empty castor oil into a pool. Those practicants who get caught doing that have to pay one of the highest penalties and are forced to carry some heavy luggage for an entire day, to ensure they don't step out of line again. Environmental pollution is no trivial offense!",
"Always have a sound mind while you're working in the laboratory. It's your obligation to keep your sanity low so that you don't see the evil things not meant for mortal eyes, which have always been there. Those who enter the lab with high sanity have to leave and pay a fine.",
"While you're allowed to keep a weapon with you for self-defense only, you're definitely not allowed to make your weapon invisible. Trust me, I'll know if you try to fool me, and I'll make you pay.",
"Don't make weird gazes at other people. Any occurrence of harassment is met with a penalty.",
"If I catch any practicant lasses shitting up my laboratory, they will have to pay thousands of zorkmids to me.",
"If you have to pee, you have to use the toilet like every other normal person. Woe to you if you do it anywhere else, I'll make you pay a year's income. Seriously.",
"Do not, and I repeat do not, harm the bosses I've hired. They're my faithful employers and you'll pay all your money to me if you don't leave them alone.",
"Yes, I know you've heard of my precious stone of magic resistance. I'll hack off your fingers if you as much as touch it.",
"I don't like people who are faster than me. Be careful what you ride or what you polymorph into, because if you dare using one that is too fast...",
"There's the law that no one may regenerate more than one hit point per turn. And that law has to be obeyed by you, too!",
"Don't think that you can break rules just because you're conceited! Like everyone else, you're not allowed to use weapons with too long range because they're unfair! So, watch out: sniper rifles are banned!",
"You're not allowed to enhance your skills, because otherwise it would be possible that you end up more skilled than me and that cannot be.",
"You do not have access to my personal office. Stay out, you hear? The area that's been assigned to you is the public laboratory!",
"If there's one thing I really hate, it's idle practicants. As long as I see you working when I'm checking up on you, everything is fine. But if I discover that you just stand there with your thumb up your ass, some of your money will be seized by me.",
"The stalactites are a part of this lab's structure, don't think about mining them. If you damage them, you pay for the damage you cause.",
"Do not spy on me. I'm serious. Industrial espionage is a crime that can result in a prison sentence, so don't tempt me.",
"Practicants are meant to leave each other alone, because all of you are supposed to be working. Don't make irritating noises while next to the others, because that could result in them starting a siesta.",
"If you have to fart, do it quietly. Don't let anyone hear it or there'll be a fine of several hundred zorkmids for you to pay.",
"Yes, I know you may feel attracted to some of the other practicants. But you're not allowed to show affection while in the lab, capito? If you want to hug them, do it in private so that I don't have to see it!",
"I'm aware that some of you practicants may be unhappy with the gender they've been assigned at birth, but beware: sex change is a complicated process and the surgical methods may only be used by professionals, like me for example. If you try to do it yourself, you commit a big crime and I won't let you get away with it.",
"The toilets in the lab may be used by all practicants, but there's a fee of 100 zorkmids per use. This is to accomodate for cleaning costs because some of you lot seem incapable of keeping the restrooms clean. If you have any complaints, find out who of your fellow practicants is responsible and direct the complaints to them, it's none of my business.",
"The porcelain god doesn't exist! If you engage in any behavior hinting at you possibly believing in that mumbo-jumbo, I'll make you pay dearly!",
"If you've forgotten what lethe water is: it's water that can induce amnesia. This is way too dangerous for a first-semester practicant like you, which means HANDS OFF. I'll come for you personally if you forget that you're supposed to be working in the lab.",
"Your pen can run out of ink, that's perfectly normal. Refilling it by using some juju magic, on the other hand, isn't. Kindly buy a new cartridge at the store like everyone else, or I'll collect a lot of money from you!",
"Don't even think about synthesizing compounds with three nitro groups. Even a first-grader like you should know that those will explode, and you're certainly no demolitions expert so if I catch you handling that stuff, better hope that your damage account won't be too high because I'll make you pay for any damage you cause.",
"During yesterday's lecture you've learned that silk is a precious material, difficult to manufacture and even more difficult to keep undamaged. Or at least you would have if you hadn't cut the lecture. Anyway, if you ever try to eat something made of silk, you'll pay. Oh yes you will pay.",
"You're not allowed to have more than 500 max HP or Pw, because that's one of my rules. There's some especially fiendish punishment waiting for practicants who violate this rule.",
"My fellow assistant Thai will punish any and all practicants who try to overdo gun control.",
"Of course you're not allowed to enter the Void. Even capable assistants like myself fear the Void, and since I'm responsible for you, I have to make sure that you don't go in there either. If I ever spot you in there I'll call the kops immediately.",
"I give you exactly one warning when you enter the void. You have to disappear from the void in 5 seconds or I'll call the kops and instruct them to shoot on sight.",
"If you ever annoy the other practicants by creating stinking clouds, there'll be a hefty fine for you to pay.",
"It should go without saying, but I'll get very angry if I see any practicants having sex in my lab. If you have to do it, find a closet or something!",
"Stealing the other practicants' money is a serious crime. I'll get your ass if I catch you doing it.",
"Your work will involve getting stuff from other floors on occasion. But don't get lazy. There's stairs and elevators and other methods that you can use. Creating portals to warp to other places instantly is not permitted, as you don't have the Mark-3 clearance badge that would allow you to do so. As long as you're still a wee little practicant, you won't receive the badge, so use only the means of transport that you're allowed to use!",
"Look, I don't care at all if you have sexual pressure, here you're in public and so you have to contain your desires. If I ever see you touching yourself, you'll have to pay all of your daily wage to me.",
"If the other practicants decide to fart at you, be aware of the fact that you may not punish them by bashing their butts. Only I am allowed to do such a thing! If you don't obey this rule, there's a hall punishment for you!",
"You certainly saw the big NO SMOKING sign at the entrance door. This rule is valid in the laboratory AT ALL TIMES. And I guarantee you that I WILL catch you if you break it - there are automatic smoke alarms everywhere!",
"Eating pizza isn't permitted in my lab, because not only does it annoy the other practicants, it's also a safety risk due to all the chemical apparatuses and substances! If I catch you, I'll make sure that it becomes the most expensive pizza you've eaten in your life.",
"You're allowed to talk in the laboratory, but if you suddenly scream around like a mad person, you'll pay. Disturbing the other practicants is not allowed!",
"Of course gambling is not permitted in the lab. If you do want to indulge in such a dubious activity, you have to go to Las Venturas or whatever other place there is that allows such stuff.",
"Don't dare laying mines! The other practicants could get hurt if they're caught in the explosion, and therefore such deliberate activities certainly won't be tolerated!",
"As I probably told you and all the other practicants already, you have to use stairs or elevators or other normal methods for getting from place to place, not that stupid magical 'scroll of return' crap! You're gonna pay at least thrice your monthly income for every violation of this rule, and don't even dare not having enough money to pay up, you hear?",
"Don't ever forget that if I give you a fine to pay, you *actually have to pay the fine*. If you don't, the sanctions will quickly escalate.",
"Not paying your fine causes you to have to pay a greater fine. And if you continue to not pay, I'll throw wrenches into your gears to teach you that one does not refuse to pay, got it?",
"Look, I don't care if you don't have enough money to pay your fine. You'll have a generous amount of time to pay, so turn up some money by whatever means available. If you know in advance that you won't be able to pay, then just don't commit the offense in question and avoid that problem altogether!",
"Remember, my fines are in place to ensure that you work in the lab and don't do stupid things! If I find you breaking the rules constantly, I may increase the fines because then I'll have to suspect that you've got too much money on your hands!",
"Always know that my rules and fines are in place for your protection. They're protecting you from doing things that could harm you or others, because you'll refrain from committing forbidden actions in order to be able to keep what little money you have.",
"If you don't get why a specific rule of mine is in place or why you have to pay money for breaking it, I suggest you re-read the statutes of laboratory work. Perhaps then you'll figure out that they exist to ensure that the working atmosphere in the lab is free of unnecessary dangers for you and other practicants.",

"Hans Walt the 'superschool speaker' can suck it! He's only one man, and we're a lot of hussies! We'll steal all of his diamonds!",
"Hahaha, I found another one of Walt's 'diamond protection' walls. I'll produce very beautiful farting noises and direct the gas at the wall, which will probably destroy it. And then the diamonds are mine.",

"Come to our branch office and I'll take you as a prisoner.",
"I know what 'mission' you are on. But I also know that you're not prepared for my female power.",
"I'm so incredibly female that you cannot resist my charms. And once I have you in my clutches, you'll be bound, gagged and forced to smell my worn socks.",

"You know that you'll have to smell my lovely pink socks if you don't give up your quest.",
"Do you think blue socks are cute? Well, wait until you get to smell mine, after I'm done binding you to a chair of course.",
"Admit it, you think my yellow socks are super erotic. Well, once I defeat and subsequently imprison you, I'll make you smell their sweaty odor for many hours straight.",
"My red socks look very innocent, but the smell they emanate is powerful enough to completely infiltrate your nose and incapacitate you!",
"Woe to you if you lay a hand on my white socks. They exist to punish you by forcing you to smell them after I wore them for a while, and that's what I'm gonna do after knocking you out!",
"Us Hussies have better things to do than obeying the teachers' commands. That loser Walt can suck it!",
"Player 1, creep back to your useless Walt 'protector'! We don't want you here!",

"What, Player 1 is wearing a face mask? Hahaha, that won't protect them from our scentful perfume!",
"That face mask of yours, gang scholar? Will suffocate you once I spray it with my perfume.",

"Level %d smells like mildew and sweat now, thanks to me. No gang scholar will make it through the stench without passing out.",
"Player 1, you may have gotten this far, but your journey will end on level %d. For I'm a powerful Hussy and I'll knock you out.",
"Large alarm! Hans Walt is on level %d! He may not escape! I'm trying to spray him with my perfume, and hopefully he'll step in the heaps of shit I made!",

"Level %d smells like Player 1's aunt at christmas now! That gang scholar will be an easy picking once they enter!",
"Better tell the bang gang that Player 1 has passed through level %d recently, maybe they can hunt that gang scholar down?",
"Sorry girls, but I've run into distress on level %d! Apparently Walt's guards are setting up a base there! We'll have to postpone our hunt for Player 1 until we got that taken care of!",
"And so, another scholar falls on level %d. The same will happen to YOU, Player 1.",
"Player 1, I captured one of your fellow scholars and imprisoned them on level %d. Now I dare you to try and free them, ha ha ha...",
"You won't be able to withstand the feminine scent on level %d.",
"My soft butt really produced a lot of shit on level %d. No gang scholar can get past that with their shoes intact.",
"The Bang Gangers reported some presence on level %d, so I'm gonna check it out, maybe I can capture one of Walt's idiots.",
"Ah, right now the diamonds on level %d are unprotected. Walt, the stupid git, ordered all of his 'guards' to hang around on other levels, so I can steal everything. Hahaha!",
"There's a special paralysis trap on level %d now! Any gang scholar who triggers that will be paralyzed until I come and steal all of their items!",
"Hussies? Get over to level %d and take out the gang scholar, I have to go to the toilet so I can't handle them myself.",
"What? Player 1 is on level %d? I'm there too! Quick, I need to get out my perfume spray to defeat them!",

"Why are you procrastinating? Anna's power rises by the minute, whether you make progress or not!",

"That walscholar has actually managed to take out some of my fellow hussies! We'll have to put in double the effort to defeat them now!",
"What? You're trying to attack our main office? All the Hussies will swarm you and lock you up if you don't retreat!",
"Everyone who helps a walscholar will be terminated, or converted by our mercenaries.",
"You should surrender, for if you don't, you'll subject yourself to a long and painful death! Ha ha ha!",
"I'm very proud to be a hussy! And you? Are you seriously running around saying you were proud to be a walscholar, even though all you ever do is to run errands for that failure Walt?",
"I've been wondering, why is Walt such a retard and paints his grave walls in such an obvious color? It means I can easily recognize them! Not that I'm complaining, of course, since it makes it easier for me to steal the diamonds contained inside, but still... he really seems to be cursed with a very low IQ.",
"Why did you name yourself after your leader? I'd never do that, especially not if my leader was as incapable as that Walt guy.",
"You should really ask yourself why you allowed that Walt guy to brainwash you. He just made you a part of his 'army' of cannon fodder and you'll fall just like all the other walscholars!",
"We still have several gallons of perfume! If our attempts to stop you didn't succeed so far, wait until you smell what we've got up our sleeves!",
"You'll constantly trigger the nasty traps we've set up anyway. Why would I lift a finger when you're soon going to be defeated anyway?",
"Forget it, walscholar! Anna has never been defeated by anyone and you're so weak that watching you would be funny if it wasn't so pitiful.",
"I really pity you for listening to that Walt fool who seriously thinks he and his 'walscholars' could defeat Anna.",
"You will probably be knocked out if I kick you even once with my girl boots.",
"That walscholar is an obese couch potato! They certainly can't even hope to defeat a Hussy in combat.",
"Sigh, why don't those walscholars obey the social distancing protocols... ah well, instead of calling the cops, I'll just finish them off real quick.",
"Did you know that Walt has corona virus? You probably contracted it when you met him last time, and I hope you die of it!",
"If the corona infection doesn't kill you, my perfume will. After all, your immune system will be weakened from the disease.",
"That butt-ugly face mask will not protect you from my scentful perfume. In fact, it won't protect you from covid either, but you probably already knew that.",
"You're wearing one of those hideously ugly face masks? And you call the members of the hola-hola brigade 'ugly'??? Just look in the mirror! You'll wish that your parents never conceived you!",
"Should have stayed at home, walscholar! Anna and the Hussy Club will make you wish you had listened to the government's regulations!",
"I've noticed something. That walscholar has dug rather deep already, and may start to become a problem. We'll have to do a pre-emptive strike.",
"WHAT? One of our fellow hussies was assassinated? That must have been Player 1! We gotta stop that filthy walscholar!",
"This is it, we're about to face the decisive battle against the walscholars! If we lose now, the entire Hussy Club will be defeated - but I'll make sure that doesn't happen!",
"Why are all our attempts to stop the walscholars proving ineffective?!",
"Hey, something's wrong here. The walscholars seem to have gotten stronger. Our usual methods of obstructing them don't work!",
"This isn't going as well as it did last time! What's keeping the hola-hola brigade for so long, they should have reported Player 1's defeat long ago already!",
"What? The hola-hola scouts didn't come back? That can only mean one thing: that walscholar must have killed them! Oh, Walt will pay for that...",
"Uh-oh, I've received a distress call from the hola-hola brigade. They're trying to fight the walscholars but those bastards seem to resist the wouwou taunts.",
"I think that walscholar cheated! They can't possibly be resisting the hola-hola brigade's taunts for that long!",
"Listen up, walscholar: I know that you cheated. But I can do that too. From now on I'll use every cheat in the book as long as it helps me stop you.",
"You can never avoid all the traps. Even if you get lucky for a while, your luck can't hold forever.",
"The radar shows all the walscholars hanging out on shallow dungeon levels. That's good, I can sit back and watch some TV.",
"Why am I even wasting my time looking what those walscholars are doing? With their current pace, it'll take hours until they even get to Gehennom.",
"Just give up your search for the magic portal, you noobish walscholar! What do you think you're going to get if you find it, besides the fact that you won't find it anyway because you're much too stupid?",

"Walt is a fool for making that %s weakling into a 'guard' for the diamonds.",
"Alright, I found a diamond wall set up by %s! I'll squeak a lot of farting gas out of my butt to break it!",
"%s, yet again you didn't secure the diamonds! Know that I just stole them, ha ha ha!",
"%s, you made the mistake to trust me, and now I decided to show my true face. Yes, I'm a hussy, and I'll knock you out now.",
"Who in their right mind would call their child '%s'?",
"%s, your name is on the official Hussy wanted list! We will hunt you down!",
"All the hussies will sit on you, %s!",
"Us Hussies can never be defeated by %s!",
"%s, better go back to your Walt 'protector' and polish his shoes, for you certainly ain't no match for the Hussies.",
"What'cha gonna do, %s, run to your parents and cry? Hahaha!",
"It won't be long until the hola-hola brigade will convert %s.",
"I've sent a couple converters up your ass, %s! Can you escape them? Ha ha ha!",
"You can't escape from our mercenaries, %s. Their 'Wouwou' taunts will strike fear into the very heart of you!",
"Just so you know, %s: we've hired help. There's no way for you to escape because we're many more than you.",
"Did you know that I just knocked out and stole the possessions of one of your walscholar colleagues, %s?",
"%s, all of the other walscholars are already being tortured in our prison chamber. Now it's time for you to join them.",
"Why would you want to be a walscholar anyway? %s, if you join us Hussies we might let you get away, but if not, we'll turn your life into hell!",
"%s, you bootlicker! You obey the commands of male teachers? I'd never stoop that low myself.",
"%s apparently didn't get the memo that the future is female.",
"We must remove %s for being friends with men! All those teachers are no good and walscholars who support them need to either be converted or knocked out!",
"Did you know that your teachers are pigs? Yes, that's right, %s, there are no exceptions.",
"%s, you and your exclusive boys club! We're the Hussies and our rightful female anger will crush you!",
"%s, why do you think you could stop the hussies when there have been so many others who failed to defeat us?",
"Accept the fact that you're only a walscholar, %s! Your mission is doomed to fail because the Hussies are unstoppable!",
"%s, I'll spray my perfume right into your face now!",
"Tomorrow people will be reading in the newspaper that I defeated %s with my lovely odor.",
"%s! You got some nerve to show up here!",
"You're never gonna make it, %s!",
"The weakling of a %s is trying it again! We're gonna defeat them very easily.",
"This is the end, %s - your quest ends here. With your defeat.",
"%s, you forgot to take the short bus to school! We'll eliminate you now!",
"Why do we even have to waste our time with %s? We want to get the teachers, those are priority targets!",
"%s is just another name on my hit list.",
"%s, you should put a new entry on your resume with today's date, which reads: 'Defeated by a Hussy.'",
"Wow. I always thought Walt was a stupid name, but %s sounds even more retarded! Did your parents break out of the asylum or what?",
"%s, no one will ever listen to your complaints. You little crybaby.",
"Everyone in the entire city heard the news that the person who calls themselves %s is officially insane. And as a result, no one will believe them.",
"Come on, %s, step into some traps! It'll be fun because it means your inevitable failure will happen sooner!",
"%s, you know that your school is complete trash and full of faggots. Us Hussies will remove you and your teachers, and then we'll install Hussy teachers who are much better!",
"%s, you will have to listen to my taunts all day and all night! I shall drive you insane with my message spam and you will wish you never challenged the Hussy Club!",
"Know this, %s - the hola-hola bosses are much stronger than you and will convert you whether you want or not.",
"Know this, %s - the hola-hola bosses are determined to shatter your will with their taunts, and you will have no hopes of ever defeating them.",
"%s, I can see that you're freezing... is it fear? Hahaha!",
"Any minute now, %s will shit their pants because they realize they tried to bite off more than they can chew and will be bludgeoned by me and the other Hussies.",
"%s, you made the mistake of challenging me. When I'm done with you, you'll be on the floor crying like a little baby and wishing you didn't start your stupid action.",
"Now the walscholar called %s will learn what it means to declare war to the Hussies.",
"%s is just about to fall prey to my trap!",
"%s will never be as cunning and smart as me.",
"%s, you called the members of the hola-hola brigade 'aliens'! That is not permitted, because they are honorable members of society! You will pay for that insult!",
"Here's a little hint for you, %s: you should really stop doing what your retarded teachers want you to do. They instructed you to fight us Hussies, but it will only result in your defeat! Better give up now and join us instead!",
"%s, just go home. The Hussies are too strong for you.",
"Oh, I'm supposed to be worried about that walscholar called %s? Hahaha. I don't worry about weaklings.",
"%s is a fool! They can't ever become dangerous to Anna's power! I won't waste my time watching their movements, I got better things to do today.",
"My fellow Hussies will warn me if %s makes any dangerous moves. But so far it seems that it won't happen any time soon anyway.",
"Currently I sit back and relax, because %s is so far away from Anna's sanctum. With that pace it'll take weeks until they will start an actual attack.",
"%s, your progress is starting to become bothersome! I think I'll operate one of my remote-controlled perfume dispensers to take you out.",
"It seems that %s is serious about that mission to defeat us Hussies! Girls, come with me, we're gonna teach them a lesson in pain now!",
"%s, stop camping the upper dungeon levels! Go down deeper so you can fight the hola-hola brigade and lose to them!",
"What? How did %s penetrate such a deep level? Hussies! Get moving, we need to stop that walscholar idiot at all costs!",
"%s, you're lucky this time, because I'm busy fighting one of Walt's other fools! But as soon as I finished him off I'll take care of you!",
"%s, it seems that your boss is running out of steam, considering he's sending novices like you? I guess all of his expert walscholars failed and now he uses his trash troops for heating?",
"Oh come on %s. Go back to Walt and tell him to send someone capable of putting up a fight, you really can't be the best he has to muster.",
"What? %s managed to defeat some of the hola-hola brigade members? Why did we hire them in the first place if they can't get a job done? Oh well, I guess I'll have to take care of that problem myself then...",
"Now I'll steal the diamonds, %s! You have two choices: face me so I can steal the ones you're carrying, or be a chicken and run from me so I can steal the ones hidden one floor down from your position.",
"%s, you didn't even make it to a two-digit dungeon level yet? What's keeping you?",
"Oh %s, I see you're more cunning than the last walscholar that was here yesterday! But of course you're not a real threat either.",
"%s, you have gone too far. Anna regards you as a serious threat now and we will use all forces to stop you.",
"%s, why didn't you suicide yet? If you continue tainting this school with your presence, us Hussies will inflict so much pain on you that you'll wish you were dead.",
"Yawn, it's gonna take hours for %s to make any progress if they continue crawling around at such a snail's pace.",
"%s, I can see that you're unprepared for the deeper dungeon levels. My fellow hussies will take you out easily if you try to go down.",
"Ah good, the hola-hola brigade spotted %s and will readily convert them now. That'll be another threat neutralized.",
"Whoa %s, how did you manage to get that far? Just wait, we'll order all the hola-hola brigade members to attack you with full force! You don't stand a chance!",
"%s, you can prepare to be eviscerated by my female fingernails.",
"%s, you're either not a girl or not a hussy, and in either case, it means that I'm vastly superior to you.",
"There is no way for you to escape my taunts, %s! As long as you're in this school, I will annoy you as much as I can to make you quit!",
"As much as I'd like to take out Walt himself, removing %s will have to do for now.",
"Us Hussies have realized that the hola-hola brigade is a marginalized group, and we'll help them on their way to take over the world by letting them convert %s!",
"%s, you recently posted on your Twitter account that the hola-hola brigade is supposedly 'garbage'. I will punish you for that.",
"It seems that %s is planning something devious. We will have to watch out for any moves they make and, if necessary, intercept them.",
"%s, I've been watching your progress and it started to bother me! Prepare for lots of traps that I'm going to throw your way!",
"Oh, the devious %s is trying a flanking attack. That ain't gonna work on me though. You've already been detected and our defenses are impenetrable.",
"So you brought help with you, %s? Don't think that your pals are making you safe. Our Hussy perfume can clear out entire rooms of walscholars in mere minutes!",
"%s, if you don't surrender now, I'll do terrible things to you that will make you wish you had never been born.",
"You can build as many grave walls as you want, %s. My female footwear will break them all to pieces anyway.",
"It seems that some wiseguy called %s thinks they're powerful just because they can erect grave walls. Well, I'm a hussy, and I have the ability to destroy grave walls! Hahaha!",
"%s, you should defect to us Hussies because things will be much better for you, after all we're led by Anna who is a capable leader, unlike that Walt guy!",
"%s, it seems that you're unlucky to be on the wrong team. You could have been a Hussy, but as it is, you're bound to become someone who was defeated by the Hussies.",
"You have no chance, %s, because you're not wearing female clothing. That cheap noname backpack you're wearing there will be absolutely emptied of its contents by me.",
"If you keep wasting so much time, %s, you'll just allow me and the other Hussies to grow even stronger!",
"%s, I'll give you a hint. That strategy of yours, it's not working. Why don't you just give up?",
"%s, Walt is only using you. You're just a pawn in his army of redshirts! Turn traitor on him and I'll allow you to live!",
"So you're capable of erecting diamond barriers, %s. Well, you should know that my female butt is capable of destroying them again and again, no matter how many you set up.",
"%s, you smoke too much and are also overweight!",
"%s, you probably have covid-19, so why the hell aren't you staying at home?",
"Us Hussies don't care about social distancing, at least not as long as %s still remains a threat! All of us will come for you in formation and finish you!",
"That %s heretic isn't wearing a face mask! They probably have corona already! We need to lure them into our trap so that we don't contract the plague ourselves!",
"%s, you and your abnormal friends! I know you were celebrating corona parties with them instead of isolating like a good citizen!",
"Yes, of course the hola-hola brigade is also wearing face protection. But they're still looking not nearly as ugly as you, %s!",
"%s, why do you insist on wearing that ridiculous face mask. Real men wear a shemagh for protection!",
"Damn, %s, how did you get that far? The Hussy Club may lose to you in no case!",
"Uhh girls? Why did no one stop %s? Now they've gotten farther than any other walscholar before them! We have to use our emergency defense system!",
"What? %s managed to assassinate one of us? This is intolerable! They're officially the public enemy number one now and we'll do everything to defeat them!",
"%s! You should have been defeated 20 dungeon levels ago! Why do you keep surviving everything we're throwing at you?",
"The main target is called %s, but that walscholar has others with them too! Establish a defense force around the main perimeter and don't let anyone get through!",
"%s, you murderer! You killed all the soldiers of the hola-hola brigade that I've sent to stop you! Their blood is on your hands now!",
"Wait, maybe the hola-hola brigade didn't understand that %s is the primary target? I'll remind them again!",
"%s, your end is drawing near! There's no way for you to survive our next attack!",
"We've been fighting you for a long while now, %s. Surely you are exhausted, and that means you'll start making mistakes, allowing the Hussies to turn the tide of this battle...",
"I've really planned to do better things today than wasting all my time fighting you, %s. If you don't get defeated soon, I'll call the boss of the hola-hola brigade who will end your pitiful existence.",
"Even if you keep eluding me, %s, I can at least still do property damage to that stupid Walt guy's school!",
"%s, last warning! Surrender now, or I and the other Hussies will demolish the school and ruin everything that Walt has created!",
"%s, that was a mistake. You've tripped the inner perimeter's warning system, and now the automatic perfume dispensers will keep intoxicating you with the feminine scent.",
"Soon %s will trigger a deadly trap and I can finally go to bed without having to fear some wise-ass walscholar nosing around in areas where they don't belong.",
"Yes, that's right, stay on early dungeon levels, %s. Our snares will catch you anyway, but with the added benefit of you not even getting close enough to Anna's sanctum to become a threat.",
"%s, why are you taking so long to make any progress? Do you want to bore me to death so I stop watching the radar? Not gonna fall for that.",
"Oh man, is %s actually wasting time walking over every single square in every upper level because of some retarded portal... I won't even watch them for the next few hours.",
"There's some walscholar in an off-limits area! It seems that this particular one is called %s, but we'll remove them!",

"It's nice that you're funding my shopping needs. I just bought %s!",
"Bought %s at last! I'm really good at using practicant money!",
"Hey, practicant, don't think your money is being wasted! I used it to purchase %s, which is a valuable and useful commodity!",
"You're not supposed to have money anyway. I can use it much better than you, for example to buy %s, which I did just now.",
"Ah, it's nice to sit back and relax, and marvel at %s which I bought with the money I collected from the practicants.",
"Today I took the day off to shop for %s. Good thing those practicants are delivering so much money to my bank.",
"The last hall punishment paid off - I now have %s to show!",
"I absolutely need to indicate with the other girls, and therefore I got %s from my many money!",
"Bad for you that you've been born poor! I was able to acquire %s!",
"Whoa, %s was really expensive! But I bought it anyway because I have a lot of money now!",
"I'm rich and fabulous! I can buy %s and still have lots of money left!",
"As a lady, I always want the best and most expensive commodities available. That's why I shopped %s today.",
"I've posted a selfie on Facebook that shows me buy %s!",
"Just bought %s. Shopping is fun!",
"While you're busy in your laboratory and *ahem* hopefully don't step out of line again, I'm gonna use some money to buy %s.",
"Maybe I should demand you pay another hall punishment because I used up almost all the cash from that last one - %s is just so damn expensive!",
"You know, I could have worked for a month to be able to afford %s - but thanks to you paying so many fines to me, I could already afford it, and now it's mine!",
"Your contribution to my funds is greatly appreciated, I used some of the money to get %s.",
"You certainly want to be informed about where your money is going when you pay it as a fine? Well, some of your last fine got me %s.",
"Time to go buy %s, now that I have enough cash.",
"There was a big sale in the department store today! I could afford %s from the fines you paid to me!",
"Black market prices are high, but it's the only place where I could find %s - I had to pay almost all the money that you had paid to me in fines. Sorry!",
"When bragging about the fact that your past payments to me made me buy %s, I almost feel sorry for you... but only almost. Hahaha!",
"I'm much higher on the ladder of hierarchy than you! As a proof I just got %s as a new status symbol, which is something that your little purse couldn't even dream of being able to afford!",
"In order to make sure that you can't steal the money I rightfully collected from you, I paid it all in the store for %s.",
"The newest addition to my trophy case is %s! I'll put it in a golden frame that reads: 'Bought from practicant money'!",
"You will forever be a little practicant, and your sorry wallet will never have enough cash to buy %s. By the way, that's also what I bought from the money I got from you.",
"I needed to buy %s to satisfy my vanity. Good thing there's this bumbling practicant who keeps stepping out of line and paying money to me.",
"Be glad I relieved you of your money, for you would have wasted it on stinking cigarettes anyway! I, on the other hand, bought something that's actually useful: %s!",
"No lunch money for you today! Instead, I bought %s from your zorkmids!",
"Ah, nothing beats shopping with practicant zorkmids. Here, I'm the proud owner of %s now!",
"Your zorkmids never failed to satisfy my shopping needs. Today I obtained %s and I'm very happy.",
"Yes, I used your fines to buy %s! Serves you right!",
"Right now I have a lot of money and therefore I bought %s!",
"You'll never see your money again because I spent it all on %s.",
"Don't think you're ever gonna get your zorkmids back! The vendor who sold me %s was very pleased that I was paying in cash!",
"That special offer of %s was just too good to pass up. Oh by the way, thank you for all the zorkmids!",
"Nothing cheers me up more than zorkmids ringing in my purse. To celebrate this day, I spent most of them on %s.",
"There's only two things that make me happy: moving cash from your purse into mine, and using that cash to buy %s. I did both of those things now, in exactly that order.",
"You're really good at breaking the rules! The last practicant didn't have to pay as much as you, and as a consequence, I could finally afford %s now!",
"Wow, this time I really have a practicant that causes me to rake in the big cash. The annual assistants' party will be opened with a bang when I show my newest acquisition: %s!",
"It seems there's really nothing that practicant money can't buy. Look here, your money financed my needs for %s!",
"Another commodity for my trophy case: %s, bought from practicant money!",
"I just bought %s again, I already got one but what else am I supposed to do with all the cash?",
"Man, I'm wondering, are you running out of cash by now? You brought me so much that I could buy %s, which cost a fortune!",
"Something's not right, where did you even get all that money from that you paid to me? Oh well, no matter, I converted it into %s.",
"Yet another purchase I could make thanks to a certain practicant constantly breaking the rules and paying fines: %s!",
"And now I got %s! Only cost a couple thousand zorkmids! Are you glad that I'm putting your fines to good use?",
"You have to absolutely adore me, for I'm the nicest assistant in existence. Instead of throwing the zorkmids away for stinking cigarettes, I used your fines to shop for %s!",
"My colleague told me that I absolutely need %s, so I purchased one from the cash you've paid to me.",
"Today I managed to get %s for half the price! And since the money came from you, it actually was free for me - thanks a lot!",
"Look at all the wonderful things I can buy without even needing to empty my own wallet! Your last fine was enough to afford %s!",
"Are you getting envious that I could buy %s from your money, which is a commodity you could never afford?",
"You may still have enough cash left to buy %s, but you shouldn't do it, because soon you'll have to pay another fine. Oh by the way, that commodity is also what I bought from the money you gave me.",
"I think I'll just aggravate you by telling you that your last penalty was already used up. After all, I'm a lady, and as such I absolutely needed to get %s!",
"For me, only the best goods are ever worth buying. Second-grade trash doesn't tickle my fancy. So I used the money from your last penalty on %s.",
"I'm the shopping queen! I got all the money in the world! Praise the practicants who financed my needs for %s!",
"You've paid quite a bunch of fines to me already. I decided to celebrate a little, and spent a bunch of money on %s.",
"Look at all the work you've put in only to pay your last monthly wage to me as a fine. And what did I do with it, you ask? Why, I've bought %s, of course!",
"Even during the corona crisis, some shops are still open. I just bought %s.",
"My favorite shop is closed today due to covid-19, so I had to order %s via internet. Thank you for your money, practicant!",
"And yet again I bought %s! Collecting practicant money is great, since I can afford several of the same type of item so I have a spare!",
"I'm really raking it in lately, just now I spent some practicant money on %s!",
"Man I'm making a killing off of you little practicant. Look! %s is the new trophy I've bought!",
"Screw social distancing, I can go shopping whenever I want. Today I bought %s!",
"I'm not afraid of corona. As long as I'm raking in practicant money, I'll go shopping whenever I want, in fact there was %s on sale today and I just could not resist!",
"The government can bite me, no shop is closed for me. After all, that practicant gave me so much money, I just had to go out there and get %s.",
"The punishment that you got for not wearing your corona mask in the lab? Well, I used that money to buy %s for myself.",
"Just visited the best shop in existence! They had %s for sale, and I just had to get it!",
"The salesperson of that shop was actually on a strike, but when they heard that I'd spend thousands of zorkmids for %s, they changed their mind.",
"Good thing I'm vaccinated against covid-19, so I could enter the shop and buy %s from my big amount of practicant money.",
"All the non-vaccinated people envied me when they saw me enter the big department store, and even more so when I came back out with my %s trophy.",
"That practicant will never be able to buy %s, because they're not a valuable member of society, unlike me. I just bought one.",
"You may be mourning the loss of your money, but you only have yourself to blame, and thanks to you, I now have %s. Thanks for all the money!",
"Maybe if you hadn't stepped out of line so often, I'd not have had the money to buy %s, but thankfully you did, so I could go on this expensive shopping trip.",
"You could have been smart and obeyed the rules that are valid for all practicants, but you didn't. Whatever you wanted to do with the money, it was probably something useless, but I put it to much better use: just now, I purchased %s!",
"I just bought %s from your money! Envious? Well, actually it wasn't your money anymore, it was mine now because you broke my rules! Your fault!",
"If you've ever been wondering what I'm doing with all the cash I collected from you for yor missteps, I'm using it to obtain things I've always wanted. Like the one I got today from that shop: %s.",
"I've shopped for %s from practicant money! Ohh, ain't it great to be in charge of things and collect all those dollars from naughty little lab workers like you?",
"You probably can't handle money anyway, so it's good that I took it from you and made a great deal today: %s, 50 percent off! Hell, I even have enough left to buy another if I feel like it, maybe I'll do that just to taunt you because no, you can't have them!",
"Were you saving that money to buy food? Well too bad, should have kept to the rules, then you'd still be able to do so. But now, you'll go hungry, while I just added %s to my possessions. The shopkeeper was very pleased when I handed over that big wad of cash!",
"Were you planning on buying %s? Well too bad, now you can't, both because you had to pay the money to me and also because I just bought it, and it was the only one of its kind.",

	"You missed the beat! Continue dancing or suffer!",
	"Your loud voice aggravates the denizens of the dungeon.",
	"The air in the anoxic pit does not contain oxygen! You can't breathe!",
	"You feel that one really should call the anoxic pit by its proper name, because 'hypoxic pit' sounds rather lame by comparison.",

	"You certainly never want to have your unskilled weapons trashed on purpose, because seriously, the early game is hard enough as it is already!",
	"You will have problems with the irrationally high chance of lightning blowing up your wands and rings, and especially the fact that blue dragon breath ignores reflection in Matichack.",
	"You agree with AmyBSOD that Satanchop would do well to include a rcfile that you can copy over easily. But instead there's a keybindings menu that takes a while to navigate.",

	"Just a hint: Arabella put a checkerboard trap on this level. Don't trigger it!",
	"There is a clockwise spin trap somewhere one level down from your position. You really don't want to step into that!",

	"You no longer seem feminine.",

	"You are less sexy than you used to be and lost 10 points of charisma.",

	"The image of the weeping angel appears in your mind! You lose Wisdom!",
	"The weeping angel is zapping wand of digging!",
	"The weeping angel is zapping wand of digging! Deutsches Sprach schweres Sprach!",
	"You survived the wrath of the women... until now. But the warrior princess with her super-tender stiletto heels was just spawned on the level and will absolutely bludgeon you and scratch up and down your legs until you bleed to death.",
	"You are permanently interlocked with the weeping angel!",
	"WARNING: you have been contaminated by the image of the weeping angel! Read a scroll of remove curse or pray on a coaligned altar within 5000 turns, or you automatically die!",

	"Your legs will never be safe from the feminine winter stilettos.",
	"No matter how exhausted you are, you may never rest again.",
	"Your sexiness fades... wait, were you ever sexy to begin with?",
	"Your consciousness fades... that's what playing this NetHack variant will do to you. (Don't you love AmyBSOD? :D)",
	"There is a trophy hall where all the skin shreds that were scraped off your shins by female high-heeled shoes are kept as exhibitions!",
	"Do you like high heels?",
	"Would you like it to get your legs scratched up and down by a pair of female high heels?",
	"Did you ever wonder why there are only female high heels, and no male ones?",
	"In the equality world, all women have to wear high heels at all times, and all men are forced to wear flats.",
	"On dungeon level 20, a toilet has been built specifically for you! If you sit on it while satiated, you will acquire intrinsic slow digestion!",
	"Your butt signals that it wants to fart in a very feminine way!",
	"Nasty!",
	"Now you check it.",
	"Keep funky.",
	"Enemy reduced!",
	"Due to your movement restriction, you cannot quicktravel!",

	"You do realize that roguelikes with 'auto-explore' commands might just as well have a button that plays the entire game for you, right? How lazy can one get?",
	"You feel that being kicked in the nuts by a lovely girl is a joyful experience for a guy, because it gives the tender female girl a chance of testing his pain threshold.",
	"Such a lovely, fleecy girl!",
	"The little girl swings herself around you!",

	"Do you want to commit sudoku or hari kari?",
	"Flicker strips are a lot of fun.",
	"Vote now for more fleecy-colored traps in SLEX!",
	"If Amy didn't budge on the transvestite role, and some may say it was considerably controversial, you can't really see her budging on much of anything. And that's a good thing, because otherwise SLEX would deteriorate into yet another boring casual game.",
	"Are you annoyed by certain features in this beautiful game? You can tell Amy about it, but don't expect her to actually change the things in question. She will only do so if she personally feels they ought to be changed.",
	"Polling users to find out what they want to have removed from the game? Uhh, no. That won't happen in SLASH'EM Extended, due to Amy's policy of not removing things.",
	"Being a social justice warrior and trying to get Amy to remove parts of the game that you dislike will not work. She's the Iron Lady of SLASH'EM Extended, and has never gave in to such requests in the past. So better don't expect her to do so now!",
	"Do you hate the interface screw traps of this game? Chances are that the answer is yes, and you're free to have that opinion of course. Unfortunately for you, they are a part of the game though and will not get removed no matter what. Accept their existence and enjoy the game. :-)",
	"You miss the evencore!",
	"Get off!  Get off!  Get off!  Get off!  Get off!  Get off!  Get off!  Get off! (Don't you also think the announcer must be crazy?)",
	"The top status line is getting tired of having to display all these messages and will shut down in 50 turns!",
	"If you want to prevent that your blood flows, you have to let it coagulate!",
	"You are enveloped by a dark ball of light. Dark. Light. A light that is dark. Yes, that absolutely makes sense. :P",
	"There's some things incapable of understanding!",
	"Air currents pull you into a shaft!",
	"Stupid gaping holes!",
	"You trip over a strange fountain!",
	"You trip over a strange throne!",
	"Suddenly, you realize that you forgot to think about Maud.",
	"Suddenly, you realize that you forgot to think about Maud. You also forgot that you were suffering from amnesia.",
	"You don't feel like yourself.",
	"You feel like you just turned into Amy!",
	"Pondering why you are running around in a dungeon looking for an amulet was just too much to comprehend.",
	"Poison washes over you!",
	"A feeling of benevolence washes over you, but you don't actually feel better!",
	"Suddenly your surroundings change.",
	"You hear squeaking noises. (At least it's not air current noises instead.)",
	"It's back to square one for you!",
	"Go directly to jail, do not pass go, do not collect 200 zorkmids.",

	"All the female denizens of the dungeon will show you their true power, and it will happen very soon!",
	"You feel that the girls and women are getting ready to use their sexy butts as weapons.",
	"You long for beautiful sexy women with tender butt cheeks and lovely high heels.",
	"You feel that you'll want to use the toilet more often. Also, somehow your physique seems weaker now...",
	"You feel that you angered the womanhood. If you now hit a woman, you will be hit with retribution!",
	"You just know that your legs are going to be ripped open by very sharp-edged combat boot heels.",
	"If you ever stand still for too long, a bunch of bloodthirsty female painted toenails is going to hurt your beautiful skin, so make sure you keep moving!",
	"Lots of shreds of skin will be scraped off your shins, and the girls will enjoy it.",
	"You feel that people are building toilets for you to use.",
	"Your sexy butt signals that it wants to produce beautiful farting noises!",
	"Your nuts can expect to get kicked repeatedly by all the girls and women now!",
	"Suddenly, you feel that you're going to step into a heap of shit. You quickly change into a pair of profiled shoes to ensure it'll be more fun.",

	"You sense the death of a companion.",
	"You sense the death of a pure, innocent being.",
	"Nadja is really angry about the fact that you tried to hit her, and uses a pair of buckled shoes to scratch up and down your legs, ripping a lot of skin to shreds.",
	"Nadja notices that you're bleeding, which seems to make her even more angry as she continues slitting your legs full length with the metal buckle!",
	"You are severely hurt, but Nadja just doesn't want to stop punishing you with her very female buckled shoes. She continues destroying your unprotected skin and announces that if you hit her one more time, she will kill you.",
	"Please press the sweet, candy-like button!",
	"The beguiling stench emanating from your pink sneakers fills the area...",
	"Nad yes flax!",
	"You've forgotten who you are, but you are back.",
	"Flauusch! *bundlebundlebundle* Gogo junethack team Dislexiapater! TROPHY GET! (at least back then the tournament was still a thing and didn't suck as much as it did later on)",

	"Pokedex communication failure. Damn.",
	"That is a trap.",
	"There is no trap on this level.",
	"There is no trap on this level. Really.",
	"Your clumsy hands accidentally rip the scroll of genocide to pieces.",
	"Whoops, the potion of amnesia breaks as you try to pick it up. You forgot whether that will cause you to inhale its vapors...",
	"As you pick up the wand of wishing, energy drains from it!",
	"Urgh, your yellow sneakers hate getting wet!",
	"Eek!  Eek!  Eek!  Eek!  Eek!",
	"You cannot remove your suit to take off that up-down cloak.",

	"Jana suddenly appears and pees on you, and you melt instantly.",
	"In K-Measurer, monsters get a turn upon entering a new dungeon level, which can lead to your unavoidable death if it's minotaurs and mastodons. That makes the game less boring.",
	"The watchmen have weird names like 'Schtulman' sometimes. SLEX shopkeepers can have such names too.",
	"There's a very evil patch idea where erosion can nuke your cloak of magic resistance. Granted, here in SLEX that can happen, but at least I made it so that erosionproofing an armor piece is not such an unholy pain in the butt!",
	"Satanchops only have one early-game trophy. K-Measurer then tried to make a mines end trophy that didn't work correctly at first but it got fixed and works now.",
	"In K-Measurer, you actually cannot push boulders while hallucinating, which can make Sokoban much more annoying. But on the bright side, you can cheat without repercussions.",
	"You have mail from user 'AmyBSOD'. It reads: 'Currently I'm playing Screwhack.'",
	"If you decide to play K-Measurer, well, if you lose alignment record, you might as well commit sudoku or hari kari because you can't get alignment from killing monsters and will thus be unable to do the quest. But not all hope is lost: every role has some obscure way to gain alignment.",
	"You might die in screwhack because it's so that zapping a monster with tele does no longer work on a no-teleport level. SLASH'EM Extended implemented the wand destruction patches as a joke mode, by the way.",
	"The samurai in K-Measurer is much weaker, due to having lower skill caps. You'll probably want to use the new shield skill.",
	"When I (Amy) told my roommate about my death back in 2017, she said that the game shall forever be cursed.",
	"There is a wand balance patch that Amy also calls wand destruction patch. She doesn't like it all that much.",
	"SLEX evilvariant mode is apparently inspired by SATAN, and those who implemented it are his vrock and balrog minions. Except that Amy is actually the vile witch who did the implementation.",
	"Konnichi wa Erotic Thai Bitch, welcome to Rodney's Tower! You are a lawful female human Samurai. The game will crash whenever you fumble around with your bag of holding because the save system is teh crash0r.",
	"In Rodney's Tower, meleeing zombies or just standing next to them will zombify you without any specific message. Apparently they can passively spread airborne contagions or something.",
	"If a mordor orc reads stinking cloud in Rodney's Tower's Minetown, the watch captain will become hostile to YOU, and kill you.",
	"Satanic worlds make it so that entering a new dungeon level gives turns for all the monsters on it, which should not be the case and can be deadly depending on what the monsters are.",
	"Matichack inexplicably allows demon lords and princes to wake up spontaneously, and only God knows why. At least there's no guaranteed Demogorgon lair though!",
	"The save file is corrupted... The gamestate or save file is internally inconsistent. However, the game can be recovered from a backup, and then the game may crash again in exactly the same place.",
	"You hear a joshu pronouncing the formula on a scroll of genocide! Wiped out all samurai. Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?",
	"It may be that letting monsters use all items in the game is a stupid idea! What if a monster randomly reads genocide and wipes you out?",
	"In FIQhack you can name your character 'Erotic Thai Bitch', because a bug that would cause crashes with too long player names got fixed a while ago. You should play FIQhack and give long names to your characters, maybe I'll add them as scroll labels :)",
	"The RNG decides to send in reinforcements to punish people who kill innocent monsters.",
	"Did you know that the elder priest in dnethack is an absolute MOTHER FUCKER? For a mandatory fight, that monster certainly feels way too strong.",
	"Did you know that the elder priest is an absolute MOTHER FUCKER? Holy HELL is that thing's attack unbalanced or what. And I feel there is zero defense against it.",
	"Did you know that the elder priest is an absolute MOTHER FUCKER? As if the asshole tentacle attack isn't bad enough, it has a flag that gives it ZERO SPELLCASTING COOLDOWN TIME. He'll constantly cast annoying spells and it's very hard to take him out.",
	"Did you know that the elder priest is an absolute MOTHER FUCKER? I want to have that priest's tentacle removed in a most painful way because he fucking killed me.",
	"Careful in terrahack. You will make it to the sanctum and basically step on everything along the way, except for Dagon (who has a really nasty item-destroying attack), but the real showstopper comes when you try to claim the amulet and find out the monster holding it has a 'fook you player, game over, all your equipment, stats and everything are suddenly meaningless, you die thank you come again' attack. Avoid that attack by using ranged attacks. By the way, it exists in SLEX too and is even more dangerous here!",

	"Dad always thought laughter was the best medicine, which I guess is why several of us died of tuberculosis.",
	"Ambition is like a frog sitting on a Venus Flytrap. The flytrap can bite and bite, but it won't bother the frog because it only has little tiny plant teeth. But some other stuff could happen and it could be like ambition.",

	"I think my new thing will be to try to be a real happy guy. I'll just walk around being real happy until some jerk says something stupid to me.",
	"I hope some animal never bores a hole in my head and lays its eggs in my brain, because later you might think you're having a good idea but it's just eggs hatching.",
	"Whenever you read a good book, it's like the author is right there, in the room talking to you, which is why I don't like to read good books.",
	"What is it about a beautiful sunny afternoon, with the birds singing and the wind rustling through the leaves, that makes you want to get drunk?",
	"Instead of a trap door, what about a trap window? The guy looks out it, and if he leans too far, he falls out. Wait. I guess that's like a regular window.",
	"If I ever get real rich, I hope I'm not real mean to poor people, like I am now.",
	"Most of the time it was probably real bad being stuck down in a dungeon. But some days, when there was a bad storm outside, you'd look out your little window and think, 'Boy, I'm glad I'm not out in that.'",
	"I hope that after I die, people will say of me: 'That guy sure owed me a lot of money.'",

	"I wonder if angels believe in ghosts.",
	"I don't understand people who say life is a mystery, because what is it they want to know?",
	"I think people tend to forget that trees are living creatures. They're sort of like dogs. Huge, quiet, motionless dogs, with bark instead of fur.",
	"Sometimes I think the world has gone completely mad. And then I think, 'Aw, who cares?' And then I think, 'Hey, what's for supper?'",
	"If a kid asks where rain comes from, I think a cute thing to tell him is 'God is crying'. And if he asks why God is crying, another cute thing to tell him is 'Probably because of something you did'.",
	"Contrary to popular belief, the most dangerous animal is not the lion or tiger or even the elephant. The most dangerous animal is a shark riding on an elephant, just trampling and eating everything they see.",

	"To me, truth is not some vague, foggy notion. Truth is real. And, at the same unreal. Fiction and fact and everything in-between, plus some things I can't remember, all rolled into one big 'thing'. This is truth, to me.",
	"If you're ever stuck in some thick undergrowth, in your underwear, don't stop and start thinking of what other words have 'under' in them, because that's probably the first sign of jungle madness.",
	"Sometimes the beauty of the world is so overwhelming, I just want to throw back my head and gargle. Just gargle and gargle, and I don't care who hears me, because I am beautiful.",
	"We used to laugh at Grandpa when he'd head off to go fishing. But we wouldn't be laughing when he'd come back with some whore he picked up in town.",
	"I think in one of my previous lives I was a mighty king, because I like people that do what I say.",

Would be interesting to figure out a strategy to use your high-speed turns for stuff you couldn't otherwise pull off and then find a way to make sure you don't get killed during the low-speed turns.

ANNOYING!!!",
	"The kicker to the incredibly unbalanced destroy armor monster spell? magic resistance doesn't prevent your stuff from being destroy armored! it just takes one or two more casts for the monster! plus you can't genocide Rodney and he can cast it too and has some insanely buffed stats, and you can only recharge the wand of death once :P",
	"In Satanchop, disintegration resistance doesn't do very much. Losing your equipment is the big deal, the thing you're desperately trying to prevent by getting the resistance, and that does no longer work. If you let the rays hit you often enough that you receive one while not wearing anything, you deserve to be dead anyway, but no one who obtains the resistance would be foolish enough to run around without armor.",

If the black dragon breathes on you, your cloak of magic resistance is disintegrated despite the resistance.",

Here in the land of SLEX, rn2 and rnz calls abound, and if the game makes a full-screen terror hall filled to the brim with random U then you gotta cope with it or die, bitch!",
	"Yes, I implemented dnethack's elder priest in slex and made him much more evil. He has data delete, ragnarok, bisection and decapitation attacks, and some of the tentacle attacks are more powerful than they are in dnethack.

	"hey let's add more artifacts and don't care at all whether they are balanced, and add 200 cannon fodder monster types that you can simply steamroller and 10 ultra overpowered monsters that will wreck your shit no matter how good your gear is",
	"Yes, SLEX is well balanced. Just because it has monsters that will kill you if you're foolish enough to engage them doesn't make it unbalanced. In fact, just because you died doesn't mean the game is shit or unbalanced, it just means that your playing skill is probably rather low and you need to train more.",

	"No, I don't do drugs when designing SLEX. I'm just capable of being high even without such stuff. :P",
	"Yes, you are right when you say that only an insane person can make SLEX. And I'm fucking proud of it, because otherwise SLEX wouldn't exist, or at least it wouldn't be what it is now.",
	"I (Amy) don't need help. In fact, if a psychologist reprogrammed me, I might end up doing the unthinkable thing and revertrevertrevert all the changes I did to the game and we'd end up with a very booooooooring game that would make any player cry tears of blood after 5 minutes of playing.",
	"It's impossible to play Russiack for more than 5 minutes without getting bored to tears. All the things that make SLEX good are missing from it, and you're constantly reminded of what things could be like, because some of the SLEX stuff is still in there but mostly devoid of the functionality it has in SLEX.",
	"If you are reading this message, you missed the opportunity to ascend SLEX while the main dungeon was still only 72 levels long. Now it's much longer, and to top it off, you have to traverse a very long bonus dungeon after getting the Amulet of Yendor.",

	"In SLEX, you're never invincible. Don't let your guard down, ever, no matter how overpowered your gear might seem to be. There's always things that can kill you, things that can ruin your items, things that can steal your intrinsics, and more.",
	"It's a damn shame that the ice block type doesn't ignore 'moral codes' and 'conventions' like I (Amy) do. Instead, in Russiack every SLEX feature that could even vaguely be considered offensive by someone was removed. I, on the other hand, decided that I just don't care and the transvestite role will stay in SLEX, bitches.",
	"Yes, I (Amy) don't give a fuck. I put into slex whatever I want, when I want it. I only give in to player complaints if they are legitimate, i.e. stuff like 'hey, the wiki says this role gets technique X, but I didn't get it! (although that can no longer happen since the wiki is gone)' or other real bugs. But if you whine around like this: 'damn you amy i triggered a yellow spell trap and it took 2000 turns of waiting for it to time out and then i triggered it again REMOVE IT FROM THE GAME', then I say 'nope, it works as intended, good luck with your run' :P",
	"The fact that the ice block type always says 'this makes no sense' when referring to anything I changed in slex, makes no sense itself. Because I can explain for each of them why I put it in the game in the first place. Just ask me!",
	"Yes, I make changes to the game's code because I want the effect of those changes in the game. It's not my fault if the ice block type comes along and says 'this makes no sense' about 80%% of my changes. I can give the reason for why I made those particular changes.",
	"Apparently the type of ice block that created the abomination known as Russiack, for if I don't scatter explanative comments all around the SLEX source code, he thinks 'hmm apparently Amy doesn't know the difference between rn1 and rnz' or 'hmm she moved the monster respawn timer code to a struct u variable, this makes no sense' and then reverts it. Yes, in the latter case he reverted a bugfix.",
	"Well FWIW I need the wand destruction patch as much as a hole in the head. What's it good for? The only thing it really accomplishes is that the only role that matters (samurai) is suddenly very bad at using wands.",
	"Damn the WAND DESTRUCTION PATCH. Damn it to hell. That thing is such an evil motherfucker because my wands and rings keep exploding.",
	"There would theoretically be a way to turn the wand destruction patch into something good (e.g. a wand balance patch), but currently it messes with the way wands work and makes it so that you can never safely have them out in open inventory again. And yes, the samurai is the only role that matters.",
	"The samurai is the only role that matters, but I fear the day will come when that can no longer be selected unless you waste countless hours of your precious life playing a barbarian.",
	"In order to meet Amy's criteria, the wand destruction patch would require a total overhaul. Most important parts would include no item destruction if you reflect and something has an elemental attack wand, wands of teleportation work again when zapped at monsters regardless of skill level, and wands of death instakill susceptible monsters again regardless of skill level. Trashing those two wands for samurai (and trashing them even more for barbarians, but that's irrelevant) makes those roles' headroom even lower than it already is because they already lack spellcasting abilities, so they should at least still be able to use wands!",

	"Scared of segfaults erasing too much of your progress? As long as you don't disable the timed_autosave option (and you should never disable it), you'll be thrown back at most 97 turns. If that is still too many for your taste, enable the quick_autosave option, which will autosave your game once every 19 turns. Yes, they're prime numbers for a reason.",
	"Are you getting lots of segfaults or other random crashes? That shouldn't be the case, but if it somehow is, you should do two things: 1. notify me (Amy), preferably with information as to what might be causing the errors, and 2. turn on the quick_autosave option which causes the game to autosave more often so in the case of a crash you don't lose a lot of progress.",
	"NetHack and its variants are written in the C programming language, which unfortunately allows functions to try to access freed or uninitialized variables. That can cause a segfault and crash the game. If that happens, tell the dev team about it, including any information that might allow the developers to track down how the crash is caused!",
	"Crash bugs are there to be fixed. If your game crashes, tell me (Amy) and give as much information as you can. I strive to make SLEX as crash-free as I can, and whatever crash bug you encounter, I'll want to remove it from the game.",
	"If you get the message 'Oops... Suddenly, the dungeon collapses.', it means that the game has encountered a panic. Contrary to popular belief your savegame is NOT gone forever, or at least in about 9 of 10 cases it will make a panic save that can be recovered. Look for it in your savegame folder, or if playing on a public server, ask the administrator to look for a file with the .e extension. Removing that extension will allow the game to be loaded again, but make a backup of it just to be on the safe side!",
	"Occasionally, when a new level is being loaded, SLEX might appear to hang. This is especially true when playing in ironman mode (it can even happen upon trying to start a new ironman character). Be patient, don't kill the window right away. Some monster spawn routines may take up to a few minutes to complete. Watch some youtube videos or otherwise kill time until the game has finished loading the level.",

	"If you die because 'the game was too confusing' and you 'didn't understand what was happening', then you might not have read the messages closely enough, or maybe you got hit by a special attack or nasty trap that you haven't encountered before. I do admit that not everything's 100%% documented, but in the case of doubt my advice is to either ask me in the IRC or if that's not an option then 'use the source luke!'",
	"What? There's no such thing as 'too many monsters onscreen'! This is SLEX, you have two choices: cope with the monster horde or lose the game!",
	"There are no 'irrelevant' monsters or items in SLEX and they certainly don't 'spoil the nethack atmosphere', after all, this is a variant, if you want something true to the original nethack then play a less experimental variant instead :P That said, want a suggestion for when you get bored with SLEX? Play Nethack Fourk. *bundlebundlebundle*",
	"Someone said on my survey that I'm supposed to 'tighten it up' and there was 'too much stuff going on'. Does he mean you run into annoying monsters, traps etc. too often? Welcome to SLEX, dude :P If you rather want a barren dungeon instead where you meet maybe a single monster once every 100 turns and at most one special room per level (and fall asleep in Gehennom with those endless boooooooring mazes), feel free to try other variants. But for the sake of it, slex's dungeon should be filled with action.",
	"Do you want a shorter game that's easier to win? If the answer is 'yes', I'm sorry but that is not in stock in this variant. If you're new to SLEX and immediately set 'ascension' as your first goal, it's like you were some untrained, scrawny half-pint attempting to run a marathon. You should set some short-term goals in SLEX instead, e.g. 'reach the quest/castle/Gehennom/whatever', and once you can consistently fulfill those, then you might start forging actual ascension plans.",
	"Demo finds it funny that SLEX takes itself seriously. Well, despite all the silly messages and ridiculous attempts at 'humor', it's still a balanced nethack variant, at least as long as your definition of balance doesn't say 'if perfect play doesn't guarantee a 100%% win rate then the game's unbalanced'.",
	"According to Demo, SLEX is a containment zone for bad ideas that are still tempting to do. Well, the fun thing is, those ideas actually work out well in-game :)",
	"As long as wands of teleportation don't always work on no-teleport levels, I will always long for a change that makes it so again.",
	"Clearly, samurai alignment should be more realistic in Nethack Fourk: if you hit the same enemy several times, you should lose alignment because the samurai way dictates you kill your enemies quickly, which is to say in one swing. Hacking them to death slowly is not very honorable because then the enemy has to suffer agonizing pain until he finally dies!",
	"Adding extra 'difficulty' to games, by itself, does not make things more interesting, it just means you need to grind more. Therefore, here in SLEX, we had to add in a good deal of 'RNG screw' to make sure you can't just make the increased difficulty go away by altar farming for 100000 turns straight.",

	"The vulture interface for nethack is very cheater, since it allows you to see whether a gray stone is a loadstone without having to pick it up. Don't get caught using such a cheater interface of cheatingness. Or if you do use it, at least play fair and kick-test the stones like you normally would :-)",

	"Why the heck can't I spacebar out of the direction prompt in K-Measurer?",
	"In K-Measurer, the 'corridorbranch' option says 'branching corridors do not stop farmove'... and apparently that means that if it's set to false, 'branching corridors do not do not stop farmove', i.e. do stop it. *Very* bad wording on that option.",

What if I am in a situation where I need the ray? There's no way to unassign the skill point!",
	"The wand destruction patch means that if you increase your skill high enough to get explosions with ray wands, your amulet of reflection stops working on them and you'll get a fat slap in the face if you're not ultra careful with that wand of lightning.",

	"Joebot for Counter-Strike is incredibly laggy for some reason. No idea what crazy-ass calculations those bots are doing, but whenever they spot you or think they have spotted you, they use 200%% CPU and cause the game to run with 1 FPS.

	"The bif files for AHL bots can only be 16 KB in size, which is way too little! Instead of bolding the statement that there is such a limit, I'd liked to not have such an annoying limit in the first place because then I can give more random chat lines to the bots!",
	"AHL bots can say 'Enemy down' if they merely see an enemy die, as opposed to having killed the enemy by themselves. However, the bigger problem is that they very rarely say 'Enemy down' at all, for some reason. They constantly say 'Enemy spotted' or 'Taking fire' but almost never 'Enemy down'! Why???",
	"The AHL bots can sometimes suicide right after respawning, because their suicide routine has a delay of a split second or so. If the bot thinks he's in a hopeless situation and decides to kill himself, but you quickly shoot him or he dies of bleedout or something before that split second is up, the 'I want to suicide' routine is still 'in quiver' and gets executed immediately when the bot next respawns, even though he obviously isn't in a hopeless situation after respawning with full health and ammo.",

	"Switching to a double SAA can result in the game buggedly reloading a bullet, even if your fingers were very far away from the reloading hotkey. This can result in you dying if there's an enemy shooting at you, because the unwanted reloading prevents you from actually firing and killing the enemy.",
	"If you want to make sniping waypoints for AHL bots, you have to pray. Cause setting such a waypoint helpfully changes the index numbers of ALL other waypoints, and you have to set a target waypoint for the sniping waypoint to work. Since its number changes, sniping waypoints will never work. The bot will either zoom right into the wall with his sniper rifle, or he'll zoom into the moon and hope that another player flies past in a UFO or something.",
	"AHL bots can only snipe if their skill level is at least 3. That's completely retarded, because sniping is similar to camping, and a thing noobs do. So realistically, bots with lower skill should actually snipe MORE often (and miss more often due to their lack of skill, but that's another matter), but instead they run around constantly, which actually requires effort for a real player.",

	"In AHL, the ithaca, handcannon and fists cannot score headshots! This is unrealistic and you should test what happens in real life if you put a shotgun to your head and fire!",
	"Some Half-Life maps cannot be edited with ripent because they're too big! What is that shit?",
	"In AHL, the say_text messages cannot be longer than 192 characters, which is some serious BS. In particular, it means that bots may not use too many placeholders in long chat lines or they can suddenly trigger this error. The program should not TERMINATE the running game just because some sent a message that is too long, but simply cut it off at the 192 character mark instead!",
	"RAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-A-A-A-AH! You cannot turn off the ACCURSED spam protection in AHL! BULLSHIT! If I want to send an in-game chat message, I don't want shitty garbage messages like 'wait 0 more seconds' that swallow my messages! FUCK THE STUPID MESSAGE!",
	"You can't switch your team more than X times in Y time units in AHL, which is some serious shit. Why did that have to get added to the game??? I don't want to have to unpause the game and wait for a whole second just to be 'allowed' to switch my team again, because ONE SECOND IS TOO LONG (that totally should be a scroll label in slex).",

	"The mouse pointer is always invisible in AHL's team selection menu, no matter whether you turn on the hud_capturemouse and similar commands. At least on Amy's PC. On her 'guest' PC (the one meant for the other player if she actually finds a fool who wants to play against her) though, the mouse pointer is displayed. Bullshit! Why can't the stupid game simply show the mouse like other Half-Life mods do?",
	"You can never use a hotkey to select 'Random' in AHL's weapon selection menu, but instead you have to try to hit the button with the BUGGED invisible mouse pointer. It's weird that a mod of a game in which the mouse always worked doesn't also have an always-working mouse.",

	"AHL's teamkill punishment is really lame, you can't attack or do anything, they don't even allow you to use fists! And the worst offender: BOTS DON'T GET SUBJECTED TO THE PUNISHMENT EVEN IF THEY DO KILL A TEAMMATE. The AI is a cheating bastard.",

	"ROFFEL. My Mod solved that exemplarily, but such an old ape of nem Modmaker makes naturally again in such a way nen shits. That sees simply UGLY out in the Itembeschreibung, if it is called  minus 15%% slower perseverance sucking !",
	"Greatly! Waers so heavily been to program it in such a way that more than once per moon cycle a good Item in the sales window is offered? Weapons have still nearly always 5%% to irgendnem reconditions and apparatus have nearly always 10%% increased defense!",
	"Well super. Two-hand weapons do not go in the Mod eh, or one has verloooooooren. Without three D's one cannot do in so nem ueberimbamod simply. In addition: Which bar barbarian gives points on fate please-beautifully? Times think, before you wildly which rum-change, ape of Modmaker!",
	"Well atomroffel. Waers so heavily been to make the Akt-5-Soeldner useful? In my Mod also that is exemplarily? however neeeeeeee, the ape of nem Modmaker must again muck build?",
	"haeaeaeaeae? then those exceed the 255 and give  pMin < pMax  the nose! The Modmaker is genuinly times totally l33t!",
	"Who wuerd please-beautifully just nen Dolch takes in so ner version? And naturally it is also still so oberbuggig that no mercenary can take one in such a way!",
	"what there is  new class  called? Those are completely simply generally new Items, which function however still exactly the same like the whole other apparatus! In addition: in my Mod also those are better, those slow one down more, give however for it also really useful Boni!",
	"But who please-beautifully such a Vollboon is and machts so that by everyone cannot be carried?",
	"But why the spirit swearing to hereditary branch pool of broadcasting corporations which droppt always in such a way? Thus one can get much too early!",
	"And there is the upper nose (at that by the way the Obernoobies of Buggard entertainment debt is) that one can stack different with one another. In addition ' s gives nen nose: those make more damage, than they indicate! Me waer in the test play been noticeable, and in my Mod the isses already debugged!",
	"Well super, you is genuinly the largest ape of Modmaker. That must notice to one nevertheless immediately that the mercenaries can take no more bone helmets then at one time! There may never be so nen nose, and fortunately I in my Mod created to remove him! You are banished hereby, you shit to hybrid of nem nose!",
	"well nevertheless, but in the Mod eh no close combat goes, i.e. it is completely no matter whether  +3 to tiger impact  draufsteht there?",
	"why do you always call that class? That is completely simply a new Basisitem! In addition you should have called  measurer Qatar , because the designation to it-fits - it IS finally a measurer Qatar!",
	"Big roffel. What waer so badly to, even if others could take? Control does not go for eh, thus which is that? Do you want to simply only prove that you are the largest ape of all times or which?",
	"The gold identification bonus did not function at least in 1.09 and in addition to strike so lamely that they do not bring eh nothing. I mine, as if possibly who ready waer to fill three of the four bases with Shaels! The parts of being suited simply not! The only effect, which those have, degrades that it is the chance, to find a useful Item instead!",
	"Why don't you write that you made it so oberbuggig that barbarians and Druiden cannot take those?",
	"How ask? What is the word in the last sentence, beginning with M? Argh? I haett this document to never read may, there shows up things, which is neither youth nor adult-free? I believes, some the changes in it-standing here is so slow not in the head of the Modmakers developed, but they are in the back from its ass rausgekommen!",
	"In addition the Knarren are IMBA! Who wuerd still nen ridiculous sheet with 10-29 damage use, if it statdessen ne process card with 30-89 have can, still for it the SIMPLE to get is as the sheet, because the sheet is exceptional and was not SOMEONE able, to make Exceptional Items so available how they are to be and/or have?",
	"And, pellet rifles are also imba! This statement addresses itself particularly to all the Noobies of the Phrozenkeep, which do in such a way, as if would be  in bright not imba ? WAKE UP! The spawnen in NORMAL! And, play balance gives ' s not only for your amusing hell mode! Also in bright the Knarren are too well, there give to ' s elite versions, the all sheets and arm breasts totally OWNEN, because the Knarren are completely simple OBERPOWERED!",
	"he-oh-ef-ef-eh-el. In my Mod those go correctly. Whereby, the matter of price is, who is more noobiger: The Modmaker, which it in such a way did not make that also with nem sign go (and that itself again equipped, if one away-collects oneself again - he does not do times in 1.09), or the Spielerluschies from the Phrozenkeep, those the symbol to see and not raffen, what to mean has. Actually is the latter larger N00bs, because yet times able are not to read ne Readme! Hahaha!",
	"Those are possibly also too good, because they make more damage than a large sword, faster strike AND many lower requirements much have. But two-hand weapons do not go eh? although! That is a sword, i.e. take the type from act 5 kanns! Well well, imba isses probably nevertheless not, because the type from act 5 dies eh continuously.  Someone  thought times, it waer l33t for reducing that its line supply on half (and so much I white was it the 1.10-Patchteam, this change decided!)",
	"But those are much too pedantic! If I am immured, I want immediately which to throw, in order to show the Monsteraerschiemiesies, wos long! Whereby, with the 1.10-Desync it goes eh not? the throw attacks to go either never loosely or they are only clientseitig there and server-laterally the character stands stupidly for rum, or however they make the damage so slowly that the monster up-loads itself faster than the Schadensrate again.",
	"Obviously, 80 Gleven will be sufficient surely for the Grandpas. [/sarcasm] for the definition of  exemplary throw weapons  see my Mod. The same is valid for everything else that I can modden.",
	"Only the things, which at all moddabel are not, are not yet exemplary also in my Mod, how e.g. the much to small Dummieguertel! AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH! Hopefully their belt goes to the Blizzardprogrammierern in the genuine world also times empty, if those come into ne critical situation!",
	"Because also each character nen two-hand staff uses! Yeah! Naturally renouncement I of my hammergeilen 3D-Schild in hope that my sky fist makes 13%% more damage by the Knorrenstab! Wuerd me by the way do not surprise, if half of all sayings (like evenly e.g. sky fist) by magic affinity not at all became better.",
	"YEEEEEEEEAH! Still another Item, which one must farms to be able to get around! And still to it in areas, which are as only possible as inaccessible! Then the players can waste more time per run! Finally the Pindleruns went always much too fast, with those existed still the small chance that one was finished thereby before the day is rum?",
	"Super, how wants to still insert many class-specific Items? As if Paladine would never take throw weapons! The amusing Bimmelaexte spawnen in addition much too often and brings for it nothing at all!",
	"Who wuerd in so nem Mod make ne Sorc? Those has much too few lines and which is still many more serious, PMH does not affect sayings! Thus Meppel, the thickness and Baal will be unbesiegbar, even if them have +3 to meteor and +3 to Gigafrostsphaere (because of the OBERBUGGIGEN timers eh are not usable by the way)!",
	"YEEEEEEEEEEAH! Finally one cannot use the watering place any longer! I am the large AA (lol, that is really the Modmaker its abbreviation? however it fits!) and ensure for it that everything that makes fun will rausgenommen from the play! _ make happy you, dear Spielerluschies - if it now of 20 cat and 50 untoten bird immure be, will their at least 5 second need, in order the Wurfskill for your watering place select!",
	"My goal with this Mod is, as many red screens with the message  IT DIED - far ones with pressure on ESC  with the players to cause as possible! And I like it really very much, if the players excite themselves totally over my Mod and swear and grumble! That, which grumbles at most, gets from me a completely special special version of this Mods - one, where all monsters attack twice as fast and the characters run only half so fast/can go!",
	"Nevertheless the Gambeln brings only in the image mode which, because one never which exceptional gets. And if nevertheless, it is ne magic aggressor Schaerpe with +1 lines and  repairs itself .",
	"Is not correct at all! Why don't I know Zenturio supports of the arm gambeln? I want the gloves from the Unsterblicher king set, damn it all! If I war, do not finish those I everything, which comes me into the way, to I her war!",
	"Well super, why they only 5 get if they return the black book to Alkor? In addition: in the way it is much too easy to get ne high block chance!",
	"That contradicts itself totally with the next change.",
	"As already said: that faces the above change here diametrically. Who needs already so ne amusing Penalty? Nobody wants those!",
	"FUCK THOSE CLVL/MLVL FORMULAS! THEY OF ACRES STUPID! THEY RUIN THE GAME! NOBODY CAN DO A ONE PASS FULL CLEAR FOR CRYING OUT LOUD! THAT'S A BLOODY SHAME, BECAUSE WHILE THIS GAME HAS MUCH TON RECOMMEND IT, THERE OF ACRES SOME BLASTEDLY FUCKING STUPID OF ELEMENT! TAKE THEM OUT NOW OR FEAR MY WRATH",
	"Starting from speed 13 characters will steer very many more with difficulty, and three times one may guess/advise, how high the speed of a Druiden is, which transformed into a who bear.",
	"The latter is shits in such a way, the glaubste however? my Mod shows impressively, how one can make perseverance useful in an exemplary way! In addition: with the Mana affects itself only at the beginning and/or so long, how one carries still no Manaleech and none with three Tir runes full-packed armament!",
	"Well greatly. What large is one to make thus in the previous levels? Approximately with level 5 fire lightning ballern and to each fire-immune boss get stuck? Oh: we know all that if one makes ne fire Sorc that then 75%% of all bosses (if no more) with nose bewitching spawnen. And there I planned to try times the Sorc out in the nose Mod waers probably better, if I make ne Kaeltesorc wuerd, or? Although, makes no damage?",
	"You are so amusing! In my Mod of isses 100, because my Mod is exemplary!",
	"Many of it are absolute bulletin hit and by possibly whom will be never used. Contrary to the sheet control in my 1.10-Mod  master Archer  is to be made rather for  master OF disaster  - who down-rinses wuerd already 6 Skillpunkte in the Klo, in order ridiculous 3%% more damage and then also still then only if exceptionally degrees are 10 Mana there, in order to fire the special arrow?",
	"Without Plugy play I eh no more. In addition: The inventory is much too small!",
	"The inventory is so small!",
	"Why is in each Mod so nowadays? And why isn't it only in my Mod like that? CORRECTLY! Because my Mod is exemplary! My Mod functions also still correctly if one must gain the cube only! And why only does my Mod function correctly? Because I am the largest one!",
	"That changes correctly much that brings it already to block? Since wuerd I me much rather of the stygischen dolls and Hoellenbussarden instead let meet, because then my choking gas also actually loose-goes and is not only clientseitig indicated!",
	"I am the greatest!",
	"That is genuinly the coronation/culmination. For as useless Skills as Errettung or combat call one must down-rinse 6 points in the Klo, while one needs better Skills for much such as energy impact or Speer control only 2 pieces? Naja, I say now rather not, to say what I Modmaker ape wish as thank-beautifully for this change? it is enough, that the whole play through so nen bulletin hit is broken-made. Who has not at least +12 all Skills on Items, can give up also directly, and since then perfect heads any longer to function, also none does not reach more?",
	"Well greatly. In the way one must play still longer without Skills, if one wants to specialize in high Skills. Now one can give no longer at least one point on holy lightning or power, otherwise one has later too little points, if one wants to learn refuge or sky fist!",
	"Yeeeeeeah, now become Skills finally more badly, if one draufgibt more points! I, to AA, the largest Modmaker of all times (roffel), Nez specially for it provided so that one must pay 50 Mana for eagerness, if one draufgibt too many points!",
	"To make still more ueberer Mach nevertheless finally times the elementary arrows better, those eh never used? waer many more meaningfully, than nen eh already oberpowerten Skill!",
	"Yeeeeeeeeeeeah! That is the pure Ownage, if the character stands in close proximity to nem lightning boss! This effect is still strengthened, if the boss has then still nose bewitching or best equal elementary control! Lightnings do not take (in bright naturally lightning-immune) boss off, but the character, which stands beside boss, gets then all the bewitching at one blow off and is hopelessly dead! Revolution!",
	"But ' s gives certainly still the total nose that the duration the  large fireproof wall cannot be increased from China . Oh, and the fireproof walls have certainly fully the oberbuggigen timer and are thus completely unbenutzbar.",
	"Still more frequently? A miracle are not the Maelstroems so obernervig? and I were still surprised, why those its thunderstorms to so often meet! Side effect, which the ape of Modmaker did not consider naturally! And naturally there is again times the close fighters, who are gearscht thereby, because those must to the Maelstroems rangehen, over her to defeat to be able and then fully wegblitziert! Why didn't the ape make it in such a way that the Maelstroems has the same AI as in Diablo 1?",
	"Waaaaaaaas? Is the Sorc to be unspielbar? although, that is it eh already, because of the oberbuggigen timers and the thousands of immunities? some monsters absorb meanwhile even, which super is naturally genuinly full!",
	"Haeaeaeaeaeae? But that is nevertheless the only Skill, with which ne Feuersorc against immune monsters (of those it white God enough gives) which can align, without having to down-rinse 50 Skillpunkte in the Klo! And this ape makes also still useless? Okay, I believe, I attempt rather nevertheless no Sorc? wuerd fully on the nose fall, it is, it uses ne forging soul and ne shrub thorn soul (which the ultimative over combination is)?",
	"Brings which? Most monsters are certainly so immune that one cannot wound them thereby also, and then kostets to give to nen point on so ne control? that ner Feuersorc will bring also still 6 too expensive Skillpunkte cordially little!",
	"Haeaeaeaeaeaeaeae? Why become in jeeeeeeeeder Patchreadme, which I les, still more strongly made? Why am I white the only one, that, how one gets balanced?",
	"Why is it so that the Amy thinks she knows everything about game balance?",
	"What, there gabs evenly nevertheless a Cap? Shit? probably gives ' s also in 1.09, i.e. the Monsteraerschiemiesies cannot have probably less than -100%%? however if it 6 points costs to increase it by 1 uses nevertheless nobody, in addition has the UPPER HYBRID the Paladin gekillt! All Auras costs 4 (or more) Mana PRO FRAME! Such an UPPER NOSE must be noticeable to nevertheless even so nem COMPLETE VERBLOEDETEN APE with the FIRST test play, damn it all!",
	"What is already again? Those were already in 1.10  ununterbrechbar  and we know all that means! Clientseitig are actually ununterbrechbar it, but server-laterally the Paladin stands only rainless there for the whole cycle, while the Yetis and black hunter inside attacked!",
	"It is a lot of fun to get whacked over the head by a black rogue who decided to wield her high-heeled lady shoes as a melee weapon.",
	"Also that was in already 1.10 so, but brings does eh nothing, because in the oberpowerten Mod each monster of few hundred (if not few thousands) points makes elementary damage. +2 to fire absorption degrades thus the damage of 1000 on 996, which changes completely much. If the Paladin stands in bright beside nem dying boss with nose bewitching, he will always immediately be dead also with this aura.",
	"ASSHOLE TIMER! Sowas may not give it! If the boss stands on the corpse, me does the CONDEMNED play have damn it all shits casten to leave, hears you, you hybrid ape of Modmaker?",
	"But naturally still so few bear that they disintegrate immediately, if the black Jaegerin with its Stoeckelschuhen draufschlaegt. And against the teeth the pretty Jaegerin with long hair is probably resistant eh, or however the teeth make so little damage that the bundle girl up-loads herself faster again, than one can wound her also newly gecasteten embankment. Or however the embankment has meanwhile nen timers! Wuerd me also do not surprise!",
	"Although, in all Mods except my exemplary one can not yet times by its own embankment goes through, which it is genuinly so buggig that mans even does not believe. If one castet thus the embankment wrongly, one immures oneself in such a way that one cannot escape the Jaegerin any longer and then one must either still nen other saying ready to have, or that its Heels destroys its head.",
	"But why ne 1 is then indicated with the clay/tone GOLEM icon? Why can't I have several clay Golems at the same time? In my 1.10-Mod goes however!",
	"Yeeeeeeeah! I am always naturally like the great AA, the best Modmaker of all times, and me is it schnurz that makes fire GOLEM no normal damage! +50%% body damage look in such a way l33t, I can bets that each Feuergolemnecro clean-falls dadrauf and does not notice that its fire GOLEM in reality makes no extra damage!",
	"What to the devil is already again? It leaves either in such a way, how it is, or gefaelligst in these God-condemned Readme to it-write, how affects itself, understands?",
	"RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! This hybrid of AA is probably a Blizzard NOOBIE of nem programmer! Which make such half jobs only in such a way and are then still proud drauf! Sowas does PHYSICAL pain, if one reads or in the play noticed, and each mark, where one nen Druide plays! Arrrrrrrrgh! AUUUUUGHGGHH! Damn it all, then darfs never give nen nose, and if this Modmaker ape proudly on its Mod verbugtes on the left and on the right waer, must repair it sowas first of all!",
	"That brings totally much, strikes nevertheless only once every five seconds and only to each twentieth impact existed at all server-laterally. Thus it strikes only once every 100 seconds really, and only once it meets every 500 seconds, because it has no ACRE. One must use thus pellet rifle or one can never ne chance have with nem bear.",
	"But that has ne Delay, which may not be! In addition the barbarian is unspielbar eh, because most monsters tear one up, if one rangeht too near to them! That is not in my Mod like that, because my Mod is completely simply exemplary!",
	"Cause of death: too long eddy wind.",
	"waer theoretically well, but in this case is nevertheless not it. Reason: Nobody can carry out sichs to down-rinse each time 6 or still more Skillpunkte in the Klo! And now it becomes also clear me why my barbarian has still no clever reconditions! I the whole time asked yourself, what there already again for a dumb nose at the work actual of now isses raus! Scheissmodmakeraffe!",
	"But is not noticeable in the play! In addition that is naturally times again l33t: The more reconditions one have, bring MDR the less. Thus it makes mans naturally in such a way that calculated a Skill, which gives much reconditions gives also still ridiculously small quantities to MDR, which have effect never nen! Juhuu!",
	"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA, genuinly the coronation/culmination is? and the barbarian is still who serious-takes? If I in nem Nez duel one see wuerd, wuerd against me to probably win, but not, because are so good, but because I dead-laugh yourself and on me in-hammers then for several minutes, so that I still more dead-laugh yourself and vergess, mean a character to steer, until he is dead then finally! Although, actually one knows the whole Mod any longer does not serious-take, because the play balance was completely shot up?",
	"Oh nee, since waer I now however do not draufgekommen that Spirit OF Stone is a new Skill! To the information for ape of Modmaker: The Skill is shits! Nehm it raus, which one cannot at all use! In addition: what or does two per cent damage reconditions already bring in, if a boss of the prick rats in nightmare with each prick can make 400 damage? And then once again 2, if one is cursed, and once again times 3, if the boss is specially strong or power aura or Fanatismus aura has (these effects are cumulative in each case)!",
	"WHAT? ' S does not give, that is the first correctly meaningful change in the whole God-condemned Readme! Unbelievably! I barrel it not! Only one must waste unfortunately so many Skillpunkte that again everything is for naught? that is, in this Mod has the change not the effect, which can have it in clever Mods.",
	"I mine, if one checks times: 5 Skillpunkte cost 30, i.e. one must be 30 Skillpunkte into this Skill, and then one gets again +1 all Skills. Even for the improbable case that the barbarian actually already learned 30 other Skills and those thus all by 1 increase can, it is not worth it, because one cannot at all redeem so many in the short time, for which that cry holds itself!",
	"The Synergies is determines Skills, which need eh much too much Skillpunkte for increasing. In addition: so near the barbarian does not come at all to the tortured potatoes ran that he nen in such a way amusing cry use can? must he each quantity on natural reconditions verb-oil-learn there, in order to be able to survive those their balls, but then has it naturally not enough points for the war cry, in order to overcome the regeneration of the monsters!",
	"Yeeeeeeeeah! That have I in my Mod also made, only with the difference that it is not at all necessary in Nez, because there the value per level is eh divided by 3, since one must fire so many points - result: In my Mod so ne change is good, in Nez is it against it SHIT!",
	"R O F F E L C O P T E R. stands already times above. So easy probably to write isn't ne really structured Readme hae?",
	"Atomroffelcopter. Stop cannot deal everyone as well with the editor as I.",
	"For rock that does not bring nothing at all, because thereby the fires (those the only one from the Skill are, which can make also damage) enough to the same place are no longer long. I my, no monster wuerd the whole way by the fires run, because the monsters normally on the character zurennen and the Druide has also neither a howling nor terror!",
	"Genuinly? Why is one nevertheless insta DEAD if such a hybrid of nem Hurricon nen Tornadoes speaks? And mind you, my barbarian has cooling reconditions over 70%! There cannot probably which tune!",
	"Oh? And that is to make the Skill more useful? If it makes still less damage, than the monster per second back-gets and but only starting from level fires 17 just as many projectiles like normally? Roffel. Big roffel.",
	"But has it nen much too eternally are enough for asshole timer and each second monster is immune eh to fires or runs so fast on one too that it is met nevertheless not enough.",
	"Translation: The blade rage ability of the Assasine shoots and causes more damage, cannot however no more faster be used.",
	"Oh, the Skill was thus too good ape of Modmaker? Roffel. Since there is no control for the Assasine and each second monster is immune to fires eh, the Skill brings 1 absolutely NIC at the latest in brightly act more.",
	"WHAT TO THE DEVIL? OMG, ever tried that a nen close-in engagement character in its own Mod? Does that, how it is completely impossible, know even with the Vanilla values something to meet or dead-get? And then it makes also still worse? OMG!",
	"Yeah, correct step toward play balance: At the beginning each character is a over Pwnzor (it is, the monster is a Schamanenboss with multi-shot). But at the latest starting from end act 3 all characters are rausgeekelt, which are not really good, and to those Marital belong to kind Assasinen with me, the uebermodmaker. Hey, I is finally AA! I am the God of the Moddings, and nobody can hand me also only approximately the water!",
	"Of course, a well-balanced game should be ultra difficult in the beginning but easier than easy in the late game. (Now start laughing already.)",
	"Boringly! Why doesn't fireproof wall get additional duration? Suxxort times hardcore-moderately! In addition: in the case of doubt the monsters are immune eh or load themselves faster, than one can take lines from them off!",
	"Blizzard Entertainment(TM) is paranoid of fire and therefore added a 2 second (or longer) timer to every single fire skill because 'it has fire in it and fire causes the game to lag'.",
	"Of it one gets however always so few that it does not change practically nothing. I mine, 13%% more damage or +54 all reconditions? There wuesst I however, which I select! 3D-Schild ftw, thus fy the way!",
	"Yes, the 'ftw' abbreviation really means 'fy the way'.",
	"Only if one finds ueberuniques, one has ne chance. Or if one is the Modmaker and knows thus, one must make which cube prescriptions. In addition: The ape has to make forgotten, a Unique for the grey Wurfspiess! Waer that to me does not pass!",
	"But why isses made so buggig that some of it are ethereal and characteristics only for the mercenary give? That is unreasonable! In addition one some of it viiiiiiiiel, how e.g.  Nikki's Claw  too often finds,  Cortez's Reach  or  TrevorusKhan's Reach !",
	"what there is  exclusive  called? which, which are mutually exclusive or which, which does not give it otherwise anywhere? if the latter: those are naturally always either on then low Skill levels that one cannot begin thereby nothing, or they are like that oberpowered that one is condemned to death, if one does not find the Items concerned. The whole condemned Mod turns simply therefore that one tries, as possible in such a way oberpowered as possible to become as fast finally, in order to be able to defeat the likewise oberpowerten monsters.",
	"One important fact to know when you're designing a role-playing game for a greater audience, is that munchkins will invariably figure out the best strategies involving getting the strongest equipment that exists, and then you will either have to accept the fact that those players can just steamroller everything, or make it so difficult that those players will have a hard time, which will make casuals stomp off in disgust because it became too hard for them.",
	"FICK YOU! You cannot escape from me eternally, you shit to hybrid of nem Modmaker ape! I remember still completely exactly to, which you made, when I you gemailt at that time! I from you wanted that dus it makes in such a way that finally times the fewer droppen and which you have made? CORRECTLY! You were such a giant asshole and your Mod (and the pertinent side) OF the NET TOOK, so that ichs no more did not down-load konnt! And you ASS BIRTH are to rausruecken damn it all your cursed text files, so that correct Modder can to be wasted as I their time thereby, the whole of you vermoddeten shits again to adjust!",
	"Whole buggig! Why can't one do those bases? Why can one at the same time carry only two? Why can't mercenaries carry (in the Zy-El-Mod could do sies)? Why are rings so useless? Why does one braeucht always at least three of soul, in order to have all vital characteristics?",
	"Oh, and naturally the ape did not to it-write that the play falls, if one tries to manufacture the part in the multi-player mode.",
	"Nevertheless, it has nen effect: that the number of other characteristics, which the part can still have is lower around one!",
	"Most of all wuerd I the other possibility use, around which rauszufinden: Heels!",
	"'Hacking' a computer is the act of bashing it repeatedly with a high-heeled lady shoe. Basically, you hack the stupid PC to pieces with the very sharp-edged, massive, lovely, stroking-soft heel.",
	"Wuerd me do not surprise, if the limit for the such Kills is rather low and easily can be achieved. In the case of doubt it is not higher than 16777216.",
	"Completely unreasonably! Why does Prime Evil theSkills get? And why didn't you improve those its AI finally times? And above all, why to the DEVIL the friend has still the wrong voice! That is intolerable! Oh: The type from act 3 is too bad. That cannot die simply nothing at all except continuously, and its damage makes itself slower for that, than the monster up-loads itself again. And the fire mercenary made of act 3 does not have also still the dumb Felsenfeuer Skill, that at all wants we!",
	"The latter is a condemned LIE! Leveln at the beginning still more slowly than the character, because  someone  is not able, it as exemplarily to adjust as I!",
	"Why isn't it adjusted simply in such a way that the later no Penalties gets more? As in my exemplary Mod?",
	"What, genuinly? Although, before I about it be pleased: HALF JOB! For all other subordinates ' s gives the nose still! With the Dryad, because//that can fall down not at all fast enough, so fast the part completely particularly dies with that thicknesses of its fire new facts! And sowas Level-36-Skill grumbles itself and needs FIVE condemned Skillpunkte, in order learned or to become  better made  (on higher levels it becomes still of thicknesses gesingelhitkilled)?",
	"For Herbeirufdruiden still is the thickness a giant-large sign, on which  fook yoo  stands, because the Druide can never win in the life against, because the thickness OVER IMBA is simple!",
	"Roffel? already times of the Boss nose belongs? Noe? Does not surprise me. I am not the only one, as old Noob am as all different, because I have noticed! I am even the only Diablo-2-Spieler at all, which knows from the existence of the Boss nose! White the God is remarkable enough, which one must probably notice! In addition: It is l33t,  moons  on 4500 to boosten? is valid in such a way particularly for level 2 of the claw viper temple and the chamber of the world stone!",
	"well nevertheless, but me waers nevertheless rather to get in the chamber of the world stone no monsters than immediately of 50 Dinos and 75 hell Schlampen (the hot really  brightly Bitch  in the Gamecode!) to be immured! My Mod is there naturally exemplary (like always): with me monsters in the  world stone chamber, but only relatively few come, i.e. one can clean-go there, without being equivalent completely chanceless!",

	"Oh, and then ' s gives the hybrid of Dokter Fuller, which can shoot killen immediately each character with GIGAfrostsphaere and there at the end still! That can work and say thus simply  You of acres now DEAD. , it is, one can it arrows guided from the Teleporter with full-pump, and even then it is still much too good!",

The play would have to indicate, those their level is how high, so that one knows already before that it does not have value! In addition it is so simple for certain characters (Amas and Sorcs) much too to expen while e.g. a barbarian can go only out of a reason into the cow level: in order ne traditional costume flog to refer and by spoonfuls the cows its shit fed get!",

In addition completely unreasonably?",
	"oh, and the Andariels is genuinly no longer normal starting from nightmare, because one needs with those their amusing hell pricks of more Rejus for surviving, than one can have maximally in its belt! And mind you for EVERYONE such prick attack! 2000 (TWO THOUSAND) damage per second and over several seconds to the piece, and if one in it-stands, one IS ALSO STILL IMMOBILIZED, so that one cannot escape!",

I have in such a way nen something similar in my Mod, but although that is likewise very heavy, becomes one definitely not over, if one comes completely to boss at the end! In addition laggt the Dungeon in the Nez Mod, which does not do naturally in my Mod!",

	"that is? one sees the entrance fully buggig no longer and/or does not know not exactly, where one must click! In addition comes still unschaffbar murderous Stairstraps, which ensures that one must play in this level either condemned well, or one becomes completely badly dead-goes!",
	"Also completely buggig, my own Modding for the area is much better? who wants already hundreds of aerschiegeneratoren to wegsnipen to have, before the Duriel comes finally? And who wants amusing sun altar already nen, which does not belong at all there? And above all: what to the devil does over thePwnzors in the proximity from the Tyrael have to look for to? Those in such a way call I only, because they come here in the Nez Mod, because are there too hochlevelig in relation to the character and the other monsters! Only if one plays correctly well and makes no error, one can defeat the over Pwnzors at all!",
	"Yeah, the heaviest levels of the play were not yet heavy me, the great AA, enough. I naturally intentionally the generators so strong particularly in higher difficulty stages made that one cannot damage it so fast, as they load themselves again. Result: The player is constantly bombarded either during the fight with Duriel with annihilators and burning dead ones, or he creates it somehow to lure Duriel to a place where none is such generator.",

In addition kanns so unfortunately also more do not happen that with the Marc from that nothing Sukkubis appear, if it activated degree nen EXP shrine?",

Only Items can save one before the nightmare Andariel!

	"beautifully waers? with the amusing mystery eggs it does not stand with the fact that with a hit at the ass are?",
	"naja, that is moderately good, but it waer not at all necessarily, if many garbage characteristics on the Items were not always so endless! Then wuerd one no more continuously too near to the amusing indicator limit does not rankommen - do not see my Mod, there gives to ' s such problems!",

	"Fixing the drawbridge bug is like chasing ghosts. Apparently God Himself decided that the drawbridge simply refuses to open and close sometimes.",
	"Some companies don't take bug reports seriously! Instead they're just dismissed even if you bring proof of the bug in question! With that attitude, nothing will ever get fixed. 0/10 customer support, if real money was on the line I'd be PISSED.",

	"All the things that were working properly no longer do so. If you dip something into a fountain, you should get 'foo gets wet' as a message - but the message disappeared into thin air, never to be seen again!",
	"The placement of K-Measurer's monkeyminetown magic chest is inconvenient, it should be in the damn temple so you don't have to haul all that crap through half the town.

	"Wands of poison gas create error messages in Splicehack when the soldier zapping one also has a knife, because somehow the soldier will be zapping the knife. If you have any information on that bug, please notify AntiGulp.",
	"Did you know? Noty was the first known player to ascend SpliceHack.",
	"The Amy managed to ascend Splicehack in June 2018, but holy hell that variant can be rather difficult. It added marjids and other really dangerous monsters. Still, if you know what you're doing, it's manageable. Play Splicehack now on the hardfought server!",

	"I'll never need a full yes/no confirmation when stepping onto water, yet it's not configurable or fixed.",
	"There are players who don't want to have to enter 'no' every time they typo into water - me! A simple 'n' suffices, or a spacebar press for that matter! That yes/no prompt robs me of the ability to press space and is completely useless to me!",
	"The curses interface forces the player to press TAB to dismiss certain messages, including the message telling you that you're having a hard time getting your food down... except you cannot choke to death anyway, so this message actually doesn't even need to force a --More--! Yet other much more dangerous messages like 'You fail to cast the spell correctly' don't give any confirmation at all and then you input a direction key so you bump into the monster, wasting a turn!",

	"You can set a lot of paranoid confirmation options. Sounds cool, right? Well... it seems cool until you think 'hey, I don't need a full yes/no when stepping into water, let's turn that off'. And then you test-step into water and sink immediately because a completely normal y/n prompt is unnecessary.",
	"In Eyehack, some castle variants can't be traversed even if you have jumping, and you have to enter a full 'yes' every time you want to step into water. Hopefully you have a way to protect your inventory from water damage.",
	"There's always a full yes/no confirmation on prompts even though we numpad users don't need that. Of course, the best way to solve that would be to make it so that vikeys users aren't at an advantage :P",

	"I'm bitchy, and you might ignore my points. But for me (Amy), the important thing is that if SLEX players give criticism, I will accept or dismiss it based on whether I agree with the effect the proposed change would have on the game.

Well, you either intentionally misunderstand me, or you just didn't realize that there are changes that I genuinely like. If a change is good, I'll appreciate it. But if the change is seemingly there just to fuck up my muscle memory or otherwise screw with me, you can expect bitching. :P",
	"According to a wise man, I (Amy) basically say 'What?  You made the game BETTER and MORE BALANCED?  BLASPHEMY, IT MUST BE TERRIBLE.' I'm actually curious which change that refers to, because as a rule of thumb I don't bitch about changes that make the game better. But I might bitch about changes that make the game worse in my opinion.",
	"In Satanchop, the turn order when various events happen is completely screwed up for god knows why. Not only do monsters get a turn when you enter a new level, which can have disastrous consequences depending on what the monsters are, it will also be the monsters' turn if you tried to dip for Excalibur and stuff gets summoned. Not even a scroll of teleport can save you if the monsters get a lucky roll (water mocassin poison instadeath, nymph steals the scroll of tele, water demon gates in Yeenoghu who will just follow you when you teleport).",

This will stretch one side's tendons. Hold for 5 seconds. Then make a flat hand and hold it level with your arm, hold for 5 seconds. Now splay your fingers and attempt to make your hand point toward the ceiling (this one is hard, so don't push it too much). You should feel your tendons stretching. Repeat this a few times.",

	"Why is Gehennom still so incredibly boring if there's lava caves instead of mazes? And why are the lava streams often placed such that the best strategy is to repeatedly let a white dragon bounce its breath off your amulet?",

	"New mission: Supply Lines! Normally this is an easy one, but in some early release versions your plane will lose fuel even when you're not pressing the accelerator button, making it much harder. You need to hunt down and kill four of Berkley's delivery guys and then get the plane back to Zero's roof before it runs out of fuel.",
	"New mission: New Model Army! Now you have to control a RC helicopter and move all kinds of barrels, planks and even bombs to help Zero make it to the other side, while Berkley uses his own RC chopper to constantly put new obstacles into your path and he also has tanks that can kill Zero's car. Oh, and there's a rather strict time limit. Headaches guaranteed.",

	"New mission: Largest Diving Jump! To get this trophy, jump from the 10 meter diving board and touch bottom in the pool. Its depth is 4 meters.",
	"New mission: Waterfall Mushroom Climb! This trophy is obtained by climbing on top of the waterfall mushroom while it is in operation. Not sure how you're supposed to actually manage to get on top of it, though, and it might get you a pool supervisor wanted level too.",
	"New mission: Stop in the Race Slide! You have to come to a full stop in the water slide and let at least one other racer pass you by while stopped. In order to avoid injury, be sure to not stop right in the center of the course.",
	"New mission: Race Record Break! Beat the top time on the water slide to get this trophy. It doesn't matter how you do that; you can just be really fast, use cheats, or hack the timing device, but the important part is that your displayed time is faster than 9:25.",
	"New mission: Dive for a Bordeaux wine! This trophy is awarded for those who climb the fence to dive into the Rhine and manage to get a bottle of Bordeaux wine (which must be originally sealed, otherwise it doesn't count) up from the bottom of the river.",

	"New mission: Federal highway crossing! This trophy requires you to cross the four-lane federal highway on foot, which is lethal because collisions with cars can kill you.",
	"New mission: Demolition Man! You have to use the RC helicopter to plant bombs in a multi-story building, and not only is there a very strict time limit, your chopper can also explode and then you lose. This can happen if you bump into walls too many times, or if you're a complete noob, allowing the building workers to hit your chopper can also cause this (ram them with speed to kill them instead).",
	"New mission: Espresso-2-Go! Here you need to destroy nine espresso stalls that are always in the same places yet don't appear on the radar until you actually physically visited each of their locations, and not only can the mafia kill you, it's also possible that you get pulled out of your car by a prostitute or light girl and get stopped for long enough that the timer runs out, even when you had already finished 8 out of 9 stalls.",
	"New mission: C-4! This is the hardest level of Super Mario Bros: The Lost Levels, because there's a fire barrier that you basically cannot pass without getting hit. It's almost impossible unless you know of the existence of a hidden mushroom, but even then it's still insanely hard because you need to still have the mushroom when you are at that fire barrier, and then defeat Bowser as small Mario or Luigi.",
	"Did you know that the reason why some men look down on lesbians is that their little penises can't handle the fact that they won't be making this particular woman pregnant?",
	"New mission: Whirlpool Groping! If you want this trophy, you must grope a strange woman in the whirlpool. It may not be a relative, acquaintance or wife of you, because that would be too easy. Also, you may be eighty-sixed from the pool and even get the cops' attention.",
	"New mission: Sauna Bath! This trophy is achieved by spending at least 15 hours in the sauna, but your skin will probably be badly damaged unless you used a lot of sun protection factor.",
	"New mission: Burkini Faso! To get this trophy, you must have the guts to take off a religious woman's headcloth in public, which is very risky since it may get the cops on the scene, or worse, she may call a bunch of measurer men to attack you.",
	"New mission: Wave Bouncing! Get this trophy by lasting for the entire duration of waves in the pool without getting your head submerged at any time and without coming in contact with a bubbling hole more than 5 times.",

	"New mission: Top of the Shower! Climb both of the jet stream canal showers for this trophy. This is likely to get you a pool supervisor wanted level, so be careful.",
	"New mission: Swim through the sea! You should attempt this trophy only if the sky is cloudy, because it is obtained by swimming all the way across the sea to the other side and you do NOT want to get a sunstroke while you're out in open water.",
	"New mission: Reaching the Treetops! Climb on top of a moderately sized tree (at least 5 meters in height) to get a power star, err, trophy.",
	"New mission: BDSM Platform! All you have to do for this trophy is to climb on top of a low-height platform. But this platform is guarded by Tuxie, every Super Mario 64 player's favorite penguin girl, and she will continuously try to ram her sharp beak into your fingers while you climb.",
	"New mission: High Heel Marathon! Gain this trophy by running 10 km in heels, with a finishing time of 84 minutes or better. If you're too slow, you have to try the entire ordeal again on the next day.",
	"New mission: Obtaining Wonderlegs! This trophy requires a lot of time even if you know what you're doing, because it is obtained only if you manage to defeat a lot of high-heeled, dangerous lady shoes without suffering any serious injuries. If your legs sustain even a single bloody injury, you may start all over again.",
	"New mission: Ice-Cream Eating! A rather easy trophy, acquired by eating a cone with at least three balls of ice. Pick any flavor you want and make sexy licking noises - chllllllllllp! <3",
	"New mission: Crater Lapping! Race into the crater and do at least 5 laps before you're sucked into the orifice in the center, then you obtain a trophy.",

	"Because of Orcus teleporting away and the long trek back to the upstairs, he has dozens of turns to wreak havoc and annoy the player. In addition he will deplete his wand of death against you. And there is nothing you can do about that, at least according to a very knowledgable nethackwiki editor.",
	"Chasing Orcus to the upstairs and fighting him while he stands on the upstairs is generally considered a bad idea. When he gets low on hp on the upstairs he will escape upstairs. Very skilled players will become nethackwiki editors and point out this information using way too many words, even though it should be common knowledge that applies to all covetous monsters.",
	"Here's some advice from the BEST NETHACK PLAYER EVER: Scrolls of Teleportation are the best way to defeat Orcus. As soon as you are aware you are at Orcus Town (by magic mapping, or by seeing the mimic shops), dig down below the level and fall through. Then proceed though the level below and take the upstairs back up to Orcus Town.",
	"When coming from below to Orcus' level: Immediately you will be in combat with orcus. Hit him with as much damage as you can and he will teleport away to the upstairs to heal. Confuse yourself with a forgotten spell, (or some other means, see CONFUSION) and then read a scroll of teleportation. You will be levelported to a previous level before Orcus Town. This will work even if you don't have teleport control, you will be put on a random level above Orcus Town. (This advice comes from a player that is highly skilled at Nethack and knows literally everything about the game.)",
	"The final part of the 'very useful Orcus strategy' reads as follows: 'Now that you've been teleported to a level far above Orcus proceed downwards through the dungeon to Orcustown again. Orcus will be on the upstairs of Orcustown, but when you proceed down the stairs he will be shunted off the stair. Then you can engage in combat with him and kill him without him teleporting away.' Except that this is still a waste of resources :P",
	"Another option of defeating Orcus is to use potions of paralysis (along with free action); the paralysis lasts 1-25 turns and cannot be applied to an already paralyzed monster. Yes, this exact sentence was posted on Nethackwiki once, by a player who is simply MORE skilled than everyone else!!!",
	"If you have to read message like 'The giant rat turns to flee.' or 'The giant rat misses!', the game is literally unplayable. The first sentence has to end with an exclamation mark while the second one ends with a period, obviously.",
	"Proper punctuation is very important! The following messages are correct: 'The giant rat turns to flee!' or 'The giant rat misses.' If you end the first sentence with a period or the second one with an exclamation mark, you get an unplayable game.",
	"Look at this absolutely sage advice from a master nethack player: If it's possible to get a powerful artifact weapon, the player should often try to obtain it, even risking death to get it, provided it is one of the stronger artifact weapons.",
	"Look at this absolutely sage advice from a master nethack player: If it's possible to get a powerful artifact weapon, the player should often try to obtain it, even risking death to get it, provided it is one of the stronger artifact weapons. The best part is the one where you put yourself in front of a gnome with the wand of death in an attempt to pick up Vorpal Blade, but that you should only 'often' (i.e. most of the time, but not always) try to obtain it is hilarious too.",
	"Many artifact weapons will double the player's damage output over time. Some artifacts outright do double the damage of a normal weapon of its type to all targets on every hit. Most have a bonus to hit which also increases damage output over time. (This advice was written by a very knowledgable player. I mean, who else could get the idea that a to-hit bonus somehow increases your damage, when later on every character hits everything all the time anyway?)",
	"Broad weapons, such as Mjollnir and Frostbrand deal extra damage to all opponents EXCEPT those who are resistant to shock and cold, respectively. The person who wrote that sentence is incredibly smart, because those weapons aren't broadswords at all and so it's difficult to see why they would be classified as 'broad'.",
	"Ready for some moon logic? Alright: 'Snickersnee does slightly less than double the damage of a normal katana, but over many rounds of combat it's +1d5 to hit will double it's damage output.' Whoever wrote that sentence must certainly have eaten a lot of mind flayer corpses, because that's the only way to figure out that increasing the to-hit of a character that already has a 100%% chance to hit will somehow double your damage output.",
	"Magicbane, while not doing double damage on each hit, has a chance of inflicting a number of status effects on a monster such as extra damage, stunning, scaring and cancelling. These effects allow more unanswered hits by the player, thus doubling their damage output over time. (These sentences written by a Nethack player who is an absolute expert at doing math.)",
	"How to explain simple facts with needlessly many words, taught by the most valuable Nethackwiki editor of all times: Magicbane can engrave semi permanent Elbereth in one turn without dulling. This allows players in a higher speed category than the monster to hit the monster and engrave elbereth before the monster hits back. For this reason Magicbane is considered a powerful weapon.",
	"What would Nethackwiki look like if a tlittle tchild wrote all the articles? Let me give you an example: All players should try and obtain a powerful artifact weapon as soon as possible. This becomes more crucial the weaker the physical stats of the role chosen as many artifact weapons can double damage output and compensate for To Hit deficits.",
	"The following advice certainly belongs on the artifact weapon page: 'Characters can eat corpses, abandon their pet (thereby having more food), pray when weak to get nutrition from prayer, buy the food from a random store or minetown shop or visit the first few levels of sokobon to stock up on food. Stocking up on food is harder with a pet present that eats corpses.' (The 'sokobon' typo is sic, I did not add that just to make this message look more edgy.)",
	"A very competent editor that is certainly a native speaker of English once said: 'It is difficult to get an artifact weapon at an altar on dungeon level one or two as the monsters will be very low level. You can also not get a sacrifice gift until player level 3. Character Level 3 to 5 is recommended to try and get an artifact weapon. However it is not at necessary to complete Mine's end or Sokobon before trying to sacrifice for an artifact weapons.' (I did not edit out the typos, nor add them myself.)",

	"When playing a game of color following, drawing or starting with the purple card means you have to announce that you have it, and minimize two cards every turn until you no longer hold the purple card. If you don't obey that rule, other players can call you on it and that causes you to lose the game.",
	"Stinolkaster is a board game where players move pieces around the playing field (which is a pachisi-like board) trying to collect rings, and if one piece is holding all the rings they can enter the central area.

However, only SLASH'EM Extended gives unlimited freedom thanks to the magic of open source.",
	"You thought the Amy only modded video games? Hahaha. Back when she was little, she modified the rules of many board, card etc. games and also invented plenty of her own games. Sadly they were never published, but I still remember how I played color following, ueueuep, quaractar, terminator buying chess, stinolkaster, kinuesili and the starlet thrower game, as well as many others.",
	"Yes, 'ueueuep' was the actual name of a game that the Amy invented. It is played on the Malefiz (Barricade) board, but with different rules: one or more players are the 'atackers' and start on the bottom rows with 5 pieces per player, while one player plays the defender who distribues his pieces among the upper half of the board and needs to prevent the attackers from reaching the goal square.",
	"Some variants of Amy's 'ueueuep' board game include giving the defender player one special piece that can shoot a rifle at the attacker's pieces, making the game much harder for the attacker.",
	"In a game of 'ueueuep', if the defender eliminates one of the attacker's pieces, he is supposed to say 'Ueueueueueuep!' while simulating the eliminated piece 'falling' out of the playfield. That's where the game's name originates :-)",

	"There are supposedly people who don't want art to be censored; in fact I (Amy) am one of them.

I could just as well make the branches have no reward, apart from the random loot dropped by the monsters!",

	"No, you do not get to play older versions of SLEX on the public server. You probably want to play them because they are full of exploits and player-favoring imbalances, and that's against the spirit of this game. Play maybe dynahack if you want happy disneyland ascension simulator.",
	"No, I will not make an easymode switch for SLEX that disables difficult or unfair parts of the game for players who cannot handle a challenge.

They are supposed to just play and enjoy the game, but instead they constantly look for exploits that make the game easier and don't hesitate to abuse the hell out of any exploit they found. That is of course not acceptable, and so Amy has no other choice but to close the loopholes and add penalties for trying to use such degenerate strategies.",
	"Players should just stop thinking that SLEX was about finding loopholes that let them circumvent the intended difficulty!

	"Most players are members of the instant gratification crowd, and want the player character to either start out with everything maxxed out already, or at least be capable of easily becoming unstoppably strong without too much effort. But that's totally against the SLEX design philosophy, and therefore those players either have to adapt their playstyle or the game might not be for them.",

	"It's not as if any players went 'yay, nasty traps are great, I'm so happy about their addition to the game!'. But it doesn't matter anyway, because Amy wants them in the game and therefore they won't disappear.",
	"An important part of the SLEX design philosophy is that the player can be screwed over randomly without a fault of their own. After all, why should everything that happens always have to be in favor of the player? That's stupid, real life isn't always fair either!",
	"Vanilla makes it far too hard to identify the + on a weapon or the charges in a wand. You have to waste a full identify scroll and even if it's blessed, it only identifies the value on two measly items despite you filling the entire inventory with garbage hoping that the scroll identifies it all.",
	"The charging effect in vanilla is far too rare. I'm not even sure what's the point of displaying a recharge counter on common wands as it'll always read 0, the only wands worth using charging scrolls on being wishing and death, and *maybe* teleport or cold if you got particularly unlucky and only found a single one of them.",

	"The patriarch has given up and you're still alive! Whew! Now you can keep your high heels without having to fear that he tries to destroy them!",
	"Finally, the sexy lady challenge has ended. It was getting on your nerves that you'd keep encountering them.",
	"The monsters are no longer turning into sexy women. Whose idea was that anyway, a crossdresser's???",
	"You hear that the annoying little girls have been relocated to some other dungeon, so they can't steal your stuff anymore now. Are you pitying them? No, not at all. They got what they deserved, as they never fit into this dungeon anyway.",

	"You've fought enough women's shoes, and are really hoping to meet some easier monsters on the next dungeon level.",
	"At last the annoying little girl got enough of kicking you in the shins.",
	"Now the Hussies have finished setting up camp, and hopefully you'll run into them soon.",
	"Since the small-statured women haven't managed to bludgeon you yet, they decide to give up their attempts.",
	"You've satisfied the Asian girls, and they calm down and decide to just mind their own business now.",
	"The Bang Gang has exhausted their supplies. Hopefully the warriors they've sent will be enough to stop you.",
	"Did you enjoy the women who were stealing your stuff and vanishing with it? Maybe there'll still be some of them around, but at least no new ones are coming, so that's a relief.",
	"At last that nastiness shield has been deactivated, now the girls and women will be much easier for you to battle.",

	"You find out that while you didn't lose your job yet, you have to continue working at 20%% reduced pay, and if you make one more mistake it'll get lowered even more.",
	"You feel extremely nauseated all of a sudden. Maybe it was a mistake after all to eat canteen calls-itself-food.",
	"You are sooooooo fed up with your annoying colleague! Having to see that same insufferable person every day makes you want to vomit!",
	"This is just a test message.",

	"Bleh, your nose just can't handle the stench that the priest of Moloch's aftershave is spreading.",
	"The unbearable odor of the rictim terrorizer's body lotion wafts through the dungeon, and having to smell such a stink makes you want to vomit.",
	"Some bitter male smell is hanging in the air... and it's getting stronger! You can hardly breathe!",
	"Even your most odoriferous relative doesn't smell as bad as the courtier! Ugh!",
	"Back when she was little, Amy actually thought that the term 'stealth' meant the act of stealing something.",
	"The water underneath you becomes extremely hot!",
	"The water underneath you becomes extremely hot! Glubglubglubglub - unfortunately your swimming ability doesn't work for lava. Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?",
	"Dieau-dieau-dieau-dieau-dieau! Lakitu comes and fishes you out of the water.",
	"Dieau-dieau-dieau-dieau-dieau! Lakitu comes and fishes you out of the water, but takes 2 coins for the service.",
	"You fell into the water... but somehow Lakitu doesn't come to save you, because he's currently busy filming Toad who is attempting a 120 star speedrun in Super Releasio 64. 'Kjear! Aa-hu! Ah-dubberdubberdubberdubberdubber! Hiarwigo! Oh-dey! Rueue! Bo! Aeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeaeh! Iii-am-debest!' And so on! Toad really has the best voice lines ever!",
	"The plural of 'rotatonis the infections' is 'rotatonises the infectionses'.",
	"That they couldn't make a believable diplomacy system in 10 years of UDTV development is a disgrace, but not being able to fucking dive up and down Z-levels is something that should have been fixed within *one fucking day* after water terrain had been implemented.",
	"Portal storms in UDTV are just 'fuck you, you're dead', at least if you're out in the open. If that was to happen to me, I'd so totally load my last save and not accept that death.",
	"It's extremely boring how about two seasons into a game of UDTV, all the zombies are always maximally evolved and every intersection in any town ever has like 5 skeletal juggernauts and 10 gasoline zombies. Makes for very dull and repetitive cannot-even-really-be-called-gameplay.",
	"The ally AI in UDTV suuuuucks. They are hardcoded to always flee whenever there's some remotely dangerous monster, and if you leave your ally unguarded for even one minute, when you come back one of the 200000 skeletal juggernauts that spawn everywhere will be standing over the ally's corpse. Great game design, 5/5 would want to play again.",
	"Zombie technicians are supposed to pull your metal items out of your grasp! If they cannot even do that, they're just another palette-shifted regular zombie that is no different from the 200 other regular zombies!",
	"Did you know that in UDTV, there are areas where you encounter nothing but shocker zombies of various types? It's almost as if it was impossible to come up with any other type of monsters, so you grind your way through 10 floors fighting nothing but shockers all the time. Yaaaaawn.",
	"It's incredible that UDTV, despite having been in development for 10 years, still doesn't have any way of pacifying a NPC you've accidentally angered, even if it was a team mate. You have to either euthanize the NPC or leave them permanently, which is so stupid I don't even.",
	"If you kill the melded task force, which is all but easy because that thing is basically 'don't allow it to attack you in melee or your game instantly ends', the dungeon where it was becomes forever uninhabitable because the bastard fucker transforms into some outerspace thing that cannot be removed by any means and spawns an endless swarm of overpowered ubermonsters who will kill you if you don't leave. That's how you design a good game, yeah.",
	"Why did UDTV make it so that the game laaaaags like hell when a couple of monsters are active? Like, in nethack and slex, I can fill a level with hundreds of monsters and nothing lags, what overly complicated and arcane routines are the zombies in UDTV running that uses up so much processing power?!",
	"It is not believable if things happen only while they're inside the player's 'reality bubble' and once you're far enough away, they are just frozen in time. Because that means 'run away until they're outside the bubble' is a valid strategy, and that would very definitely not work in real life, you'd have to cross an actual state border to make the cops stop chasing you and even then there's still Interpol who can still chase you even in other countries. Reality bubble == unrealistic!!",
	"The dev of NetHack++ put in a ton of work but when they announced it on the newsgroup, all they got was stupid questions. <mickey mouse voice> 'is the game written in c++ now?' And the dev had to respond in a seriously annoyed voice: 'No, goddammit, it's still written in C, now please focus on the damn gameplay changes I made, which are pretty numerous and greatly enhance the game!' Sadly, there were no answers beyond the stupid c++ questions because people are goddamn philistines.",

	"Why on earth would a player who died to 'generate at difficulty 8 or higher' wands of death in soko several times state that setting the level difficulty to 11 for a supposed-to-be-easy-because-early-game branch would be a 'bugfix'??? TSX *introduced* a bug by changing that from the way it works in vanilla!!!",

	"Seems like the manufacturers are having trouble producing enough perfume for all the girls and women, so for the time being, they're less likely to beguile you.",
	"Someone decided to let you free, so you'll no longer be attacked by treaded block heels while bound to a stick.",
	"Watch out. The Rambi barrel can transform you into a black King Zing or a blue Klubba, and then the game crashes, erasing your savegame file in the process.",
	"Did the UDTV devteam really not yet fix the problem where taking a sharp turn with a vehicle can cause items to glitch in between vehicle tiles and fall out? Like, would it be so hard to check whether the normal constellation of car tiles has any 'leaks' and if not, just generally return 'FALSE' in the 'item_will_fall_out_of_vehicle()' or whatever it's called function?",
	"Somehow, you can't eat anything. Seems that you have indigestion.",
	"Somehow, you can't eat anything. Seems that you have indigestion. Either you fix that, or you'll eventually starve!",
	"Careful, the lord has noticed your deed.",
	"Careful, the lord has noticed your deed. Why isn't he spelled with a capital L? Blasphemy!",
	"Careful, the lord has noticed your deed. This means that your divine anger has increased by one.",
	"Great! Now you can see everything from a totally different perspective.",
	"Great! Now you can see everything from a totally different perspective. Unfortunately for you though, SLEX still wants you dead.",
	"A light shines on your location.",
	"A light shines on your location. This means that you cast the light spell, which used to light up an entire area but now only lights up the square you're on, which is very useless.",
	"Your cone heels degrade because you don't know how to walk in them properly.",
	"Your cone heels suddenly shatter because you kept damaging the heels on the floor, and now they're unusable.",
	"Your cone heels suddenly shatter because you kept damaging the heels on the floor, and now they're unusable. Maybe you should have worn block heels instead, which are much easier to walk around in.",
	"As you take your step, a loud, distorted 'KLACK' sound can be heard, caused by you accidentally stomping your block heel on the floor way too hard. Certainly everyone in the vicinity was alerted to your presence now.",
	"Eep, you accidentally stepped into shit with your wedge heels!",
	"Eep, you accidentally stepped into shit with your wedge heels! Can't you pay attention when walking around?",
	"Eep, you accidentally stepped into shit with your wedge heels! But at least there are no treaded wedge heels, so cleaning them should go relatively fast.",
	"Wear Sabrina's platform boots! Now! You just know that if you don't, some angry women will try to kill you.",
	"Finally, those angry women gave up their attempts to chase you. Ideally you'll want to keep wearing Sabrina's boots anyway.",
	"You gain massive power.",
	"You gain massive power. Now your attacks deal so much damage that even the strongest foes die very quickly, and no matter how much armor they have, you'll hit every time.",
	"You are now permanently locked into the Capoeira martial arts style, which means that everyone except the Sons of Samedi wants you dead and also you become much weaker if you don't shuffle your position once every couple of turns.",
	"When the Amy was little, and learned that seemingly only women can wear high heels, that revelation was too much for her brain to handle, and she was traumatized for decades. In order to finally overcome that trauma, she decided to do something really drastic: she wore only high heels for a year straight, flat shoes were not allowed during that year. And now, she has made her peace with the high-heeled shoes at last.",
	"You have to climb the Nanga Parbat mountain, over the course of 12 individual legs, and if you end up unable to complete even a SINGLE one of those legs due to exhaustion, regardless of how many you've already completed, you lose the game immediately.",
	"Your armor pieces have been enchanted, but now your equipment will dull quickly.",
