Eating your own race is cannibalism and will give you permanent aggravate monster and lower your luck.
Unless you are chaotic or polymorphed into a demon, sacrificing your own race is a very bad idea.

For details on all the ways in which cockatrices and their corpses can petrify you, see David Corbett's cockatrice spoiler.
Dropping items on altars to see whether they are blessed or cursed works with an altar to any god, even Moloch.

Dylan O'Donnell's spoiler collection includes more information on donating to priests.
Unaligned altars do not appear in the main dungeon, only in Gehennom and some quests.
Wands of cancellation are not as dangerous as many people imagine.
In Slash'EM, an exploding wand of cancellation will cancel your inventory.
In Slash'EM but not vanilla Nethack, monsters can zap you with wands of cancellation.
Although being cancelled is nasty, it only affects your equipment - you do not lose any intrinsics.
Cancelling a bag of holding makes it into an uncursed bag of holding and does not affect the contents.
Cancelling the blessed rustproof +6 Mjollnir makes it into the uncursed rustproof +0 Mjollnir.

Boudewijn Waijers and Dylan O'Donnell have written a spoiler giving full details of the effects of time and date on the game.
Eating rings or amulets does not normally increase food consumption (unlike wearing them).
Gaining intrinsic regeneration, conflict or hunger by eating a ring will raise your food consumption by one point every two turns.
Normal food consumption is one point per turn.
There is no point in constantly wearing two rings of slow digestion.
Dylan O'Donnell has written a spoiler on food which includes a list of all factors which affect food consumption.
Any lawful character of level 5 or higher has exactly the same chance of getting Excalibur by dipping.
Excalibur used to blast non-Knights in version 3.3.1, but this bug was fixed in 3.4.0.
Excalibur cannot be obtained by sacrificing at all, nor can it be generated randomly.

Multiple unique monster problem also may be caused by corpses.
Levitate over a pit and drop something while blind: "You hear The amulet of reflection tumbles downwards."
You can't pick it up or enter the pit with >, which is arguably the real bug.
You have to fall into a pit, which xorns can't. Workaround: levitate and apply a bullwhip down.
After polymorphing into any non-phasing monster, you are reliably stuck in a nonexistant pit.
Immobile monsters can have the "flee" status, but will not move away from you.
When dying immediately on entering a level, the map may show you dying on the previous level.

On polymorph, the ratio HP / max HP is preserved, perhaps this bug refers to rounding errors.
Dismounting and kicking a monster that jumps may result in landing on the wrong side of a wall.
Kicking a monster makes them mnexto() you, then tries to flavour the resulting movement.
In very confined spaces, mnexto() may not be able to find a space next to you after all.
The interface isn't clear that wielding 6 daggers, or whatever, nevertheless means that you only attack with one.
For example, if you break a wand of digging on the entrance square, the shopkeeper will usually remove only some of the pits.
Several beneficial events are most likely with Luck=7, not maximum Luck. See rnl for details.
Eating a zombie of your race: "Ulch - that meat was tainted cannibal! You feel deathly sick."
In a similar vein, #praying on a cross-aligned altar also works.
"Difficult" attacks it possesses make a monster worth more experience, but the way these bonus points are calculated underrates physical damage.
"You float gently to the lava." is probably the silliest variant. The messages don't consider the fact that you're flying.
polyself.c lists claws as a horse's manipulatory appendages.
Polymorph into vampire, wish for a pick-axe, apply said pick-axe down repeatedly.
Alternatively, trigger a hangup-save after you finish digging and before you fall though.
In death messages, all shopkeepers will have an honorific, even if the shopkeeper's name is clearly a given name, not a surname (e.g. Dirk, Lucrezia, Izchak).
Messages delivered when the ceiling collapses on a swallowed hero need revision.
"For you, scum ; only 534 for this emerald ring." (note the extra space)
Message given when restoring a game refers to original gender and form, not current.

Specifically, a gremlin steals only the effectiveness of divine protection, not the amount.
If Stormbringer is gifted to a blind character, it will still be described as a "black sword".
Using a WIZKIT allows player to have too large amount of items, what results in prompts with repeated # sign.
Lava sinking is checked once per player input (inexplicably), as opposed to once per player turn or once per time-consuming action.
If you cancel the engraving text prompt or are levitating, no time is spent.
The official buglist mentions "Leave the level some other way then return to it." as a workaround.
Rust-causing targets can reveal other information about a weapon.
Wielded items are always dropped when a monster polymorphs.
Polyself into something that cannot wield (e.g. a hell hound). "You find you must drop your weapon!"

They say there are hideous things hiding in the darkness of N'Kai!

Currently, you retain your alignment record, e. g. it is possible to gain alignment for robbing a shop while chaotic and calming the shopkeeper while lawful.
This is a side effect of their touchstone, which is considered sling ammunition.
Perhaps related is the fact you can cure instrinsic restful sleep (from eating the amulet) by putting on and removing an amulet of restful sleep.
Rust monsters may chew non-ferrous items.
For example, this can mean trouble for elven priests who have named Sting and Orcrist in hopes of getting Stormbringer as their first sacrifice gift.
But they (correctly) have to take off cloaks first.
A stethoscope will appraise but not uncloak a mimic. See also #SC343-17.
Travel (_) command can get stuck trying to plot a path past an interesting dungeon feature, for example, a trap or fountain.
If you save and resume, you can use the stethoscope again for free.
On an aside, saving and restoring loses the movement points you gain from speed, and makes your exercise prior to the save worth less.
A blue jelly shopkeeper will buy and sell, but it won't move to block or unblock the door.
Does this also apply to pick-axes when you start digging?
The same applies to pet mimics whistled over a polytrap.
Spelling errors at the genocide prompt may have unintended consequences.
Specifically, genociding "master mindflayer" as a monk is fatal.
A workaround is to check if putting on elven boots gives a message.
You can write any scroll you have named, even if you don't know the "scroll called FOOBIE NO IDEA" is the scroll you are trying to write.
Nemesis ridiculii (from Soup or Sonic) is misspelled as Nemesis riduclii.
Vlad's Tower is such a place.
Possibly, this refers to multiple stacks of gold in any bag: two stacks of $49 weigh 0, but one stack of $98 weighs 1.
This might relate to shop-owned versus hero-owned gold.
You might want to pacify the shopkeeper on his home level. If necessary, steal a gold piece and pay him off again.

Works on former pets, shopkeepers, and other "special" statues. See the TAS writeup.
This is the infamous polyself bug.
This is the infamous Astral call bug.
While blind and levitating, too much information may be presented.
Does this refer to messages about monsters scared by an Elbereth engraving? Or typing > to identify the stairs?
Or to the ability to identify ground types (ice, floor, altar, grave, etc.) when hovering over them?
Refers to some general timing issues with when lava checks are run (e.g. removing fire resistance sources in lava does not instakill the player).
Checkboxes are drawn wrong.
Windows 98 is unable to load tiles that are too large. This is an OS issue.
Go back to the installation instructions and finish the install.
This patch does not apply cleanly.

They say RNG hath made that which was weakest the greatest of all.
Don't stand on a drawbridge because you will get attacked by the gnome with the wand of striking.
Go ahead. Leave autopickup on (Shift+2). It's convenient right up until the point you walk over that cockatrice corpse without gloves.
Go ahead. Leave autopickup on (Shift+2). It's convenient right up until the point you get overencumbered right when the swarm of killer bees arrives.
Identify scrolls first. It's never a good idea to read an unidentified scroll, find out it was a scroll of amnesia.
Do not read a scroll labeled ELAM EBOW that was a scroll of enchant weapon while wielding your blessed +7 Grayswandir.
Don't mess with player-type characters on the Astral Plane. Yes, there's only something like a 5% chance they'll be spawned with the Vorpal Blade.
Yes, Vorpal Blade only has a 5% chance to instantly behead you. Yes, you will die. Every time.
Levitation does not protect you from the kraken in Rodney's moat.
Even though you're fire resistant and put on that ring of levitation to get out of the lava, you'll still die instantly when your legs get stuck.
Don't try to cancel your own spellcasting by pressing Escape, especially when polypiling. Skipping the direction prompt releases the magic power to the previous direction!
When you get a blessed scroll of genocide, @ means you, even though you're a gnome.
Forcing the lock on the chest with a blunt weapon on the castle level isn't the best idea.
Kicking a chest isn't such a good idea either, if the object you're expecting happens to be made of glass or crystal.
Sleep rays bounce, and elves don't start with sleep resistance.
Beware the hallucinating pet arch-lich. (Make sure that that black light over there blows up in your face and not your pet's.)
"Huh. Didn't know a bag of tricks would explode my bag of holding."
You have to really be INSIDE a temple for sanctuary to work. The door isn't good enough, unless the monsters are inside the temple too.
Don't eat wraith corpses when satiated. You don't get a warning.
Don't wear levitation items until you need them. They deprive you of Elbereth and other useful escapes.
Levitation spells don't cut it on Medusa's Island. Find a permanent source or get skilled.
Be wary of statues in the Gnomish Mines...
Don't bring a pet gremlin to Medusa's level.
Don't panic. Always know where your towel is.
Don't EVER tangle with Cyclops, the Healer quest nemesis, in melee. MC3 doesn't help.
Be very careful with uncontrolled teleportitis in stores! Drop your gold first.
Plains centaurs in the mirror are stronger than they appear.
Baby silver dragons don't reflect zaps of cold that you shoot at them. Looks like it's going to storm!
Hitting e instead of w can be a fatal mistake when you have a cockatrice corpse.
Just because you beat Sokoban and got a bag of holding, it doesn't mean you're invincible.
Remember, "Thou shalt not worship graven images"!
Never sacrifice something you can't touch!
Never eat tins in shops whilst wielding potentially expensive artifacts.
Using waterwalking boots on the plane of water will result in you drowning. Levitation, on the other hand, will work safely.
Always use up cockatrice eggs you lay, or otherwise render them unhatchable. Tame cockatrices turn any golem to stone golems, which are hard to kill.

Don't carry wands/scrolls/potions outside bags.
Don't rely on your quest artifact as the only source of ANYTHING.
Don't stand on ice when there are foes with fire attacks around.

If you have crappy ISP, NEVER reconnect to the server Right after you got your internet connection back. There can still be some glitches with it.
NetHack doesn't know about arrows/function/home/end/page up/page down keys and treats them as escape. Therefore DON'T TRY TO EDIT YOUR WISHES WITH THEM.
NEVER have a potion stack directly on altar when there are intelligent foes. Wand of striking == BOOM!
NEVER skip messages with space. Ever. Especially when handling petrifying monsters.
What do you think the amulet of life saving is for?
When polypiling, be careful with where you aim. In particular, don't hit that damn chest with goodies - if it polymorphs into a non-container, ALL CONTENTS ARE LOST.
When you have laggy connection, NEVER type the next command before you see how the previous one ended.
When running from a nasty monster, go back the way you came.
Be careful of what items are marked as 'y' and 'n' in your inventory to avoid confusion with yes/no prompts.
Trying to eat something on the ground while levitating by typing 'ey' quickly will have disastrous effects if your inventory contains 'y - a cockatrice corpse'.
Be careful of what items are marked as direction-moving keys in your inventory, in case you miss a key.
When hiding in a shop to recover HP, make sure to rest instead of search to avoid finding (and waking) mimics.
When breaking wands for its area-denial purpose, DO NOT break a wand of lightning unless you hate your rings.
Wield the cockatrice corpse when you're already in position to attack (you won't be moving into any unknown squares).
You will fall into a pit or spiked pit on your way to your victim and be stoned instantly if you move around with a wielded rubber chicken.
When the ground around you looks the same except for being a different color, examine it with / or ; before stepping there.
Don't anger your god after getting divine protection. Praying for unholy water on a crossaligned altar, for example.
Don't go below dungeon level 18 or so without a means of crossing water. Falling past Medusa through a hole can really ruin your whole day.
Don't melee cockatrices if you're polymorphed, especially if you are a vrock, master mind flayer, vampire lord, dragon, or any other biting monster.
Don't try to polymorph a merely annoying monster just to get it out of your way.
Drop your gold, bag of holding, and unicorn horn on another square before #sitting on a throne.
If you find Minetown bones, before you go #chatting up the priest, make SURE both the priest and the altar are of the same alignment and the temple isn't haunted.
If you have no gloves and are blind and have recently dispatched a cockatrice, always move with the 'm' key. Doing so will cause you not to automatically feel objects on the ground.
If you levelport, angry shopkeepers are somehow able to levelport with you.
There is a vital difference between '<god> is displeased' due to praying too soon, and praying on the wrong altar or with negative luck/alignment. Only the first one makes your god angry.
Any monster in the 'follower' category will follow you through portals created by the Eye of the Aethiopica.
If you are being held/crushed by an owlbear, zapping down with a wand of digging is not as effective as you might think. Engrave Elbereth with it instead...
If you leave skeleton keys (but not lock picks or credit cards) lying around, monsters that can open doors are smart enough to pick them up and unlock doors with them.
If a fountain in Minetown reduces to a trickle, cease using it immediately.
For beginners: if your HP shows as yellow or red (with the HPcolors patch), you have the spell of healing and you have enough power to cast it, do so.
You'll never know which gnome has the wand of lightning/cold/fire/death.
If someone throws an egg at you, it might have been a cockatrice egg.
Don't skip through the messages about stiffening and turning to stone as if they were ordinary battle spam, if you don't want to become a statue.
If you don't have a way to protect against touch of death, NEVER step off of an E-square when facing an arch-lich.
If you're trying for #conduct weaponless, just leave pick-axes on the ground.
If you're going for #conduct pacifist, wield a cream pie and never let go. Rely on 5 to move.
Never underestimate a bones level.
While trying to tame something using charm monster that can resist, you'll probably gain a lot of pets.
Naming them *all* will help keep you from sacrificing a pet (since corpses retain names) and losing your 50 points of protection.
Get a second or third opinion. ALWAYS.
Don't eat anything while standing on Medusa's corpse. You WILL fatfinger it and suffer a legendarily stupid stoning.
Always kill shapechangers when you see them. If you don't they turn into bad things that will kill you.
A shapechanging monster might turn into a minotaur on Sokoban level 3.
A shapechanging monster might turn into a black dragon on Gnomish Mines level 2.
A shapechanging monster might turn into an arch-lich on Sokoban level 4.
Don't stone-to-flesh statues from a bones file. They are likely to be well-armed and armored.
If a human zombie dies on your altar during a sacfest, move the human corpse away before trying to sacrifice anything.
If you see any messages pertaining to a swamp, do NOT blithely skip along the level. You WILL hit the water, and all your stuff WILL get blanked.
Monsters will follow you through your quest portal. Engraving on the portal square doesn't work.
If you're dipping potions into a fountain, don't typo and dip your bag of holding. The RNG will curse it. Every time.
Actually, don't dip things into fountains at all - instead, dig down on the fountain and bathe in the resulting pools.
Wielding a cockatrice corpse around a foocubus is an excellent way to get a permanent hard-on.
Don't try to feed a dragon unless it is currently tame. If it is peaceful, thrown food will anger it.
Zapping a high priest/priestess on the Astral Plane with a wand of teleport in order to move them off an altar DOES NOT WORK. It makes them angry instead, even if they were peaceful beforehand.
Don't just try on unidentified rings if you're near a priest or any other friendly. If that ring turns out to be conflict, you won't live to regret it.
Locking a door will not do much if you leave a pick axe or mattock immediately outside it.
Never, ever, ever jump near your quest leader. Your quest portal will be removed, with only one way to salvage your game: the Eye of the Aethiopica.
When in Sokoban, and you are at the fringe of death, do not try to teleport away using a scroll of teleportation.
Sokoban is a no-teleport area, which will result in a few more hits from that monster you are trying to flee from, possibly resulting in your death.
When you solve a Sokoban level and open the door at the end of the hall, it will be packed with monsters.
One random monster in Sokoban might just be a Nymph who will charm you, steal your Wand of death, fail to teleport, then use it on you.
When attacking a gas spore, make sure your pet isn't within the range of the explosion when the spore dies. It will count as if you killed the pet.
This also applies to aligned Priests - losing the only co-aligned temple in your entire dungeon is a real bummer.
If you want to create Excalibur in Minetown, make absolutely sure that there are no guards around (or that you have a pet strong enough to deal with them).
Even if they aren't in sight, they will somehow sense you and get angry at you, and killing them counts as murder.
Don't try to polymorph at experience level 1 or 2, unless you like being killed by unsuccessful polymorphs.
Don't zap your kitten with a wand of polymorph unless you're prepared to risk the consequences of killing it yourself (System shock).
If you genocide giants before you do the Valkyrie quest, you will get lots of titans instead. You don't want lots of titans.
Before you kick in a locked door, make sure it's not attached to a shop closed for inventory, lest you anger the shopkeeper.
In Moloch's Sanctum, be sure that you have entered the temple, and that the high priest has called you an infidel, before killing him. If you don't, you'll get dinged for murder.
Don't eat meatballs while satiated, you won't get a warning!
Don't polymorph in > direction while riding. Even your ki-rin is not invincible, A's are vulnerable to system shocks!
Watch where you kill the Wizard the first time. Killing him above the moat is a VERY VERY bad idea if you can't swim and don't have a wand of cold!
When waiting for monsters to show up and force you out of were-form, don't wander away from your only weapon just because you couldn't carry it.
After you're done dancing with nurses or foocubuses, DON'T FORGET TO RE-EQUIP YOURSELF!
Be sure to remove all armor AND weapons before reverse-genociding that swarm of nurses.
A xorn will gladly munch your Magicbane, especially when you disrobe to take a bath and blank scrolls.
When you're on on a level with water or lava, and you have uncontrolled teleportitis, and your connection is laggy, TREAD LIGHTLY.
Don't forget that your start-scummed wizard can actually use Magicbane to engrave an E-square when you're facing giant ants.
Be careful about wishing for cross-aligned/cross-class artifacts when low-level or low on health, especially when said artifacts are intelligent.
When playing with number_pad off, be careful when going northwest. "Really attack Izchak?"
When in a zoo, fight shriekers and gas spores last.
Standing on a burned Elbereth and reverse genociding dragons to create DSM is a great idea... unless you have teleportitis.
Pause every time you see a monster. Watching the contents of your inventory, or what you are polymorphed into, is free. Thinking of a tactic is also free.
Going toe-to-toe with a footrice when you're poly'd into a master mind flayer is priceless.
After spending hours of hard work and effort to descend into Gehemmon, only to be swamped by monsters, remember to check your status as often as your inventory.
Scrolls of genocide may be great escape items, but only if that umber hulk next to you isn't looking your way!
And no, your AoLS will not save your sorry self if you read a confused scroll of genocide!
Werecreatures are considered human. Sacrificing werecreatures while not chaotic is not a good idea.
AVOID foocubi of opposite gender when levitating over water in Medusa's level using boots. Drowning is not kinky.
Chameleons leave brown corpses. They can also impersonate monsters which leave brown corpses.
If you drop your weapons and armor to go for a scroll-blanking swim in the castle's moat, please take care where you leave those items lying around.
Chasing down a master mind flayer that's made off with your +7 Grayswandir is not fun when you're unarmed.
When you get to the castle level, do not burn Elbereth on the drawbridge and fight the monsters there.
A wand of striking will kill you instantly while standing on a drawbridge, and it won't be fun.
Destroying a drawbridge with force bolt kills everything in the same way like closing the drawbridge. Including you.
Don't get all excited and just throw everything into your bag of holding. That pesky wand of cancellation will go in last, and then you're screwed.
If your luck is negative, or even if you think it MIGHT be negative, DON'T WISH UNTIL YOU FIX IT!
If you're confused in a shop and standing next to the shopkeeper with your very promising character, keep doing nothing for as long as it takes.
Plugging the trap doors on the castle level with boulders is a Bad Idea. It will result in the lower levels being inaccessible.
A bugle is not a good tool for a knight to use to wake sleeping monsters - especially in the mine town.
Never use force bolt in a level with a shop (you hear the chime of a cash register) if you haven't explored the area in the direction you're shooting.

When you find a small mimic in a shop, be sure to attack it, not the shopkeeper! There's no way to say that you meant to hit the mimic!

When you've been fighting hordes of monsters as a master mind flayer, remember that your stomach is now quite full.
While satiated, do not try eating anything, especially a randomly generated newt in the lower levels of Gehennom just to try and get that one extra MP for the heck of it.

Don't eat eggs unless you're sure of what's in it. Just because you haven't seen any cockatrices yet, doesn't mean the egg is safe.
Don't bang on the keyboard, you'll just be angrier.
Don't rest on the keyboard either!
Attacking a floating eye isn't always fatal... unless there are strong monsters nearby (there are).
Collecting useful items from bones files is great! Reading/Using anything immediately after isn't.
Yes, pressing any directional key counts as 1 turn, no matter what!
Have a laptop? Move carefully.
Just because your laptop doesn't have a numpad, it doesn't mean you can't move diagonally. Then again, normal numbers hate laptops that play NetHack.
The castle level is a cruel, cruel place...Trust me...

Skip the Gnomish Mines and come back when you're more powerful, or you won't get past level 3 of the main branch and die in the Gnomish Mines.

In SLASH'EM as an ice or flame mage, don't youpoly into a dragon when you are wearing armor. Unlike lycanthropes and doppelgangers, you will break out of it.

Don't even try to read spell books at level 1.
Remember, look, don't touch!
An organized pack helps. a - primary weapon, d - pick axe, g - unicorn horn, etc. Arrange to taste.
After clearing a screenful of monsters involving c, leave for the level for 250-300 turns, to let the corpses rot away.
Finding a blindfold from a bones file while having intrinsic telepathy is great!
Now don't get all excited and put on a bones file blindfold immediately after just to "try it out", because you'll be "trying it out" much longer than you'd like.
Archons' dazzle is incredibly annoying - lens are nearly worthless.
Get greedy; get killed.

Don't let the demon princes summon Demogorgon. Really, just don't.

When using an amulet of magical breathing to cross water, don't forget that the oilskin sack you stuffed your rustables/blankables into will leak if cursed.
If you do not have a greased helmet, NEVER attack a (master) mind flayer in melee. Having sustain ability doesn't prevent amnesia.
Don't believe every rumor you find. Many of them are just plain wrong.
If you're not sure about a rumor being true or not, consult Nethack Wiki, where all the spoilers are true.
Winning in Nethack without internet spoilers is possible, but please don't believe every random rumor. They might give you completely wrong directions.
If you want to make sure the rumors you receive are actually true and useful, dip your fortune cookies into holy water first.
A cursed fortune cookie will always give you a false rumor. Most of those false rumors try to make you do stupid things, e.g. telling you to melee floating eyes.
Monsters can use a ring of timely backup for a full healing. The player, however, can not.
A monster that puts on an amulet of data storage will reflect beams back at the player.

Don't pray if it's been too soon since your last prayer.

Don't pray if you have negative luck.

Don't teleport to level 0, or negative levels. These things may be funny to do once, but not in a game you care about losing.
Don't genocide yourself.
Don't wear amulets of unchanging while polymorphed unless you really know what you're doing. (Do you know what you're doing? No.)
Don't wear-test amulets; they're the only item class that has a member that can quickly kill the player in normal use, the amulet of strangulation.
It's best not to use-test things at all if you can help it, but amulets are especially important to be care of.
Be careful! When you pinch Croesus's pennies, land mines blow up your legs.

A certain rare item can rescue you if your spells become yellow and your display starts acting messy.
If everything on the screen becomes monochrome, you're really in for it. If you can't fix it in time, you die.

Digging down as a spirit archeologist is fun. But keep in mind that nymphs can steal your pick-axe.
Yes, that lich race sure is powerful. But wait until you get to the ascension run...
Think the spirit race is overpowered? They move quite a bit slower and can't eat corpses to boot.
The clockwork automaton race gets extra attacks per turn but can't eat at all.
As a clockwork automaton, potions of oil provide quite a bit of nutrition.
Unlike dnethack, Slash'EM Extended incantifiers are actually pretty straightforward.

They say that a Missingno has about a 1 in 1000 chance to crash out of the game on every turn.
You can play as a wraith, which gives you access to lots of great intrinsics.
Playing as a wraith has some disadvantages, especially if you switch weapons and armor a lot.
For a worm that walks, the saying "you are what you eat" is actually meant in the literal sense.
Annoyed that your worm that walks can't find good corpses to polymorph into? Eat other food for a random chance to polymorph into something good!
The transformer race can wield items and perform other actions even when polymorphed into a form without hands.
As a transformer, you start with uncurable polymorphitis and no protection against unsuccessful polymorphs.
There's a race called "ak Thief is dead!" which suffers from a special form of lycanthropy.
You can be an angel, but if you are, all useful intrinsics are lost if you stray at all.
Play as a devil if you wanna be able to tame other devils with your charm monster spell!
Deathmolds will randomly polymorph into some weird forms. They can polymorph at will, too.
If you're a poisoner, your weapons act like they're permanently poisoned.
If you're a poisoner, you can never be poison resistant, so be careful!
As an immunizer, you're immune to effects that temporarily disable your in/extrinsics.
As an immunizer, whenever a monster spawns you may lose some alignment record points.
The unalignment thing is a really crappy race that you shouldn't play unless you're a masochist.
Leprechauns are a teleportitis race.
Be a veela! You'll always know how much damage you're doing, and humans usually spawn peaceful!

Careful, the veela race may be very powerful but they must adhere to the knight's code of conduct.
If you choose "vortex" at the race selection screen, you can recognize certain types of monsters.
You can be Batman if you want, but doing so means you may not kill monsters of the other gender unless they're non-humanoid.

A method to get rid of burns is to allow something to freeze you.

They say that the yeek race sucks at everything but gains experience points twice as fast.
They say that yuki-onna both deal and take extra damage, which makes fights end more quickly.
They say that contamination will damage your wisdom over time, and kill you if it gets too low.
They say that contamination can be healed with remove curse or an altar of your own deity.
They say that amnesia can make you forget non-fatal contamination.
They say that fatal contamination starts with 1000 points on your contamination counter and greatly reduces your regeneration rate.
Hangup cheating is bad. Don't do it, or you lose maximum hit points and mana.
If you hang up while at "You die from your illness.", the game will remember that you should have died, and kills you upon restoring the game.
Monsters are aggravated if an angel with negative alignment record strolls through the dungeon.
They say that the elder priest can tentacle to tentacle you.

The idea of a "bundle monster" was suggested by K2.
Ski heels can really walk on snow. They're high-heeled skiers, kind of. Watch out though, stepping into dog shit with them is really shitty since cleaning them is an unholy pain in the butt!
Dipping objects that are vulnerable to fire into lava is possible, and can get rid of such items.
Curse the curses interface.
Being attacked by wereheels can make you into one of them, and then you can use kick attacks.
If you keep disrespecting Team K, you will find out the hard way that the Kops have been beefed up konsiderably.
Firing a bow, sling or similar weapon at point blank range will greatly reduce the damage you deal.
Monsters with the flickerer egotype are IMMUNE to your melee and missile attacks. Don't plug away like an idiot, use wands or spells instead!
Sling rocks aren't the most damaging ammo you can shoot. Find some flint stones!
Terror halls, trouble zones, void rooms and feminism rooms are among the most dangerous special rooms in the dungeon.
Terror halls can be made easier to deal with by blindfolding yourself as a protection from confusion gazes, but some dangerous monsters in those rooms are not detected by telepathy.
Be careful if there's a void room on the level. Once awake, the ghosts will phase right through the walls to get to you, and they're usually very high-level ones too.
If the game spawns a feminism room, be aware that all the girls in there can use their sexy butt cheeks as a deadly weapon.
Standing on grassland improves your HP regeneration rate.
Standing on grassland reduces your to-hit with melee weapons, can make your ranged attacks misfire, and causes your spells to fail sometimes.
Boss rooms don't initially have monsters, but they will spawn high-level boss monsters after a while.
Doomed barracks are a good source of shotguns and energy guns, but beware, they're initially in the hands of monsters.
The diver paradise can often be traversed only via digging, swimming or magical breathing. And the latter two methods make your inventory wet.
Shifting sand is one of the most deadly terrain types in existence. Stand on it for more than two turns and you die instantly, unless you can fly.
The nuclear chamber is a special room that's best avoided entirely, since everything in there will contaminate you.
You can dig through grave walls by simply moving into them repeatedly, but occasionally monsters or traps are hidden underneath that cannot be detected in advance.
Tunnels block movement for flying or levitating characters, but a pick-axe or wand of digging can remove them.
Farmland terrain can block your movement, but here's a hint: try using #force on it often enough and it will be removed.
It's possible to climb mountain terrain, but it can take 100 or more attempts. If you absolutely have to get past one, don't lose patience - keep trying!
Crystal water is water that clings from the ceiling, and will only affect flying or levitating characters.
Moorland will damage you continuously while you swim in it, and it's impossible to pick up items dropped in it.
If you see an important item drop on a moorland tile, you need to zap teleport or use a grappling hook or similar things to retrieve it.
Swimming in a urine lake will melt you and your inventory if your alignment record is negative.
Swimming in the styx river increases your contamination. Flying over it is less harmful but will still contaminate you slowly.
In order to draw on the powers of a pentagram, use #invoke.
You can quaff from a well in order to gain a bit of nutrition and recover lost hit points.
Don't quaff from a poisoned well - it can drain all your stats, and even kill you if you're not poison resistant!
If you stand on a wagon, you're hidden from monsters and also have higher armor class.
Stepping on a burning wagon is a good idea to get rid of flammable items and hit points.
Wooden tables are useful in case you're levitating, since they allow you to reach the ground even when you normally couldn't do so.
If you #sit on a carved bed, you will fall asleep unless resistant, and recover hit points rapidly while asleep.
Stepping on a straw mattress can cause you to spontaneously fall asleep.
Snow terrain slows you down greatly if you walk on it, or causes you to be caught in snowstorms if you fly.
Ash terrain is really solidified lava. Zapping it with a wand of fire will melt it, with fatal consequences if you stand on it.
Walking on sand can cause you to be caught in a sandstorm, which blinds you for a couple of turns.
They say that walking on paved floor makes a lot of noise, and is outright dangerous for anyone who wears high heels unless they're really skilled at walking in them.
Everyone who stands on a highway tile is capable of moving more quickly than usual.
They say that if you spend too many turns on a nether mist tile, your experience points may be drained.
They say that nether mist dissipates if a lawful monster is killed on it.
Flying and levitating players should beware the stalactites, which can deal impaling damage.
Bubbles will stun you if you step into them.
They say that rain clouds will make your entire inventory wet, so you should put away rustprone things that you want to keep. Use a wooden box or large chest.
Curased coffin is not a misspelling.
Yerles conbat plane is not a misspelling either.
Using a staircase has a significant chance of preventing the player from using staircases for the next few turns.
The summon and create undead spells have a chance of failure; players coming from regular SLASH'EM please note.
If you anger the watchmen in town levels, they will call the kops.
Walking through walls no longer allows the player to trick the monster AI into emptying their ray wands.
Chest and door traps can surround the player with new, invisible traps.
GruntHack is more evil than SLASH'EM Extended.
The elder priest in dnethack is more evil than any mandatory boss monster in SLASH'EM Extended.
The evil patch ideas implemented in Nethack Fourk are more evil than even the worst ones in SLASH'EM Extended.
AmyBSOD never makes commits that cause players to prefer earlier versions, since none of her commits are regressions.
AmyBSOD's NetHack variant is very nice, so it's a surprise that she herself is such an evil person.
Cursed invocation tools still have a chance of working on the vibrating square.
Blue walls aren't dangerous per se, but if all the walls on the current dungeon level suddenly turn blue you'd better stop bumping into them.
The devices skill can be trained by zapping charged wands, applying charged tools, or reading scrolls or spellbooks or quaffing potions.
Hint: no matter how many interface screw traps are affecting you, finding the vibrating square is still possible. Use #technique while standing on it, and you'll get a special message.
Black hashes are loudspeakers. Don't farlook them; doing so will paralyze you.
Fake artifacts resist bad polymorphs and nymph theft attacks.
They say that Vlad likes to light up his tower with various types of candles.
They say that Rodney may have built various rooms into his tower, filled with differently-flavored monsters.
Riding a very fast monster, or polymorphing into a very fast one, doesn't give you the full movement speed if your skill isn't good enough.
If you're unlucky enough to have your wish fail, you can have bad items force-welded to your body.
They say that AmyBSOD dedicates more time to SLASH'EM Extended than ToME-SX.
If you play the prostitute or kurwa role, chatting to intelligent monsters will initiate a sexual encounter.
The kurwa is a hard role.
It's difficult to reach experience level 12 with a kurwa.
One of the main weaknesses of the kurwa role is that she can get chain-paralyzed by monsters with claw attacks.
Overenchanting an artifact will set it to +0 instead of vaporizing it.
The player's armor class works less well if the player is causing conflict.
The wand of remove resistance managed to make a player ragequit SLASH'EM Extended forever.
Truck ghosts are not overpowered.
The "ugod" monster was so successful at 0wning player characters that Amy decided to add greater ugods as monsters.
They say that the nasty head spike attack used by uvuudaums and certain other monsters can instantly kill you.
There's a trap that forces you to walk like a grid bug when triggered. You also can't attack, zap etc. at a diagonal in that case.
You cannot endlessly tame monsters with a blessed book of the dead.
While hallucinating, you're resistant to stoning effects since you're already stoned.
SLASHTHEM is inferior to SLASH'EM Extended by far, and in every single way.
SLASHTHEM reverted every single SLEX change that can be attributed to Amy, even her obvious bugfixes, including the monster spawn increase timeout error and the martial arts error. As a result, SLASHTHEM has those errors again even though I fixed them.
SLASHTHEM removed the transvestite role, allegedly "because Soviet could not think of a good quest design" although we all know why he really removed it: because of his prudery.
If you REALLY insist on playing SLASHTHEM instead of SLEX, you have a clear choice: pick the soviet race in SLEX, because then you can enjoy the advantages of SLEX while many game rules behave like SLASHTHEM.
Fake artifact weapons and armor are often highly enchanted. Beware, they can also be negatively enchanted, so test their BUC first.
Artifacts can be generated cursed, just like any other item. Don't put on everything you find if you don't know whether it's cursed!
Remember that some of SLEX's artifacts have evil side effects. Just because Arabella's Warding Hoe passes the pet test doesn't mean that wielding it is safe.
Tools can be generated cursed. Just because you have the habit of putting on any blindfold you find immediately, doesn't mean that it's a wise idea in SLEX.
Be careful when wielding unidentified gems, iron balls or chains. If they are cursed, they will weld themselves to your hand!
Be sure to check the randomized appearances of your armor pieces. There are certain ones that will screw you over.
Trying to identify an item can fail. But if you try repeatedly, you may get lucky and succeed in identifying it.
Amulets, rings and armor pieces are much more likely to be successfully identified if you put them on first and expose yourself to their potentially harmful effects, although that can obviously be dangerous.
About the identification minigame, you have two choices: be bold and use/wear-test sometimes, or end up playing through the entire game not knowing what most of your stuff is.
If you're sacfesting and the altar disappears before you get an artifact gift, it's the RNG telling you that you're not getting an artifact from that particular altar and you should move on instead of complaining. Artifact gifts are not guaranteed!
If you're trying to tame a wounding knight with command undead, keep failing, and end up weak from hunger with no food, better move on and secure a source of nutrition rather than risking death by starvation!
If your doppelganger ends up losing intrinsic polymorph control to a wand of remove resistance, you should try to find a ring of polymorph control soon or just swallow your pride and play without polycontrol for a while.
If you get the superscroller, and Amy watches your game and tells you to look everywhere so you can disarm it and stop the effects, do it. In any case DON'T LEAVE THE LEVEL UNTIL YOU FOUND IT.
Don't fight thick farting girls in melee combat unless you're massively overleveled. And don't let the fact that they're only base level 6 fool you - they will mop the floor with you.
The Coure is a VERY dangerous level 1 monster. Unless you have an absurd amount of skill in your weapon and equipment that boosts to-hit, you'll probably never even land a single hit.
The xyloman is a rather hard-hitting, fast early game monster.
They say that the Seven Deadly Sins wait for you on the vibrating square level.
Just because you got the Amulet of Yendor doesn't mean you're invincible. All it takes to end your run is to get undressed by a foocubus, skip past the messages because you're impatient, and getting breathed on by a black dragon.
Don't melee gray F glyphs. This is especially true if your race gets several attacks per turn. Especially, don't skip past the messages if you do melee them!
Invisible shopkeepers don't want to be bumped into. If you encounter a shop and the expected NPC greets you but isn't visible, it doesn't mean he's not there, and thus, if you walk around randomly he'll help you get your possessions identified.
If you get engulfed on a lava level and cannot survive on lava, remember where the lava is and don't kill the engulfer while it is on a lava square!
You have to guess! Maybe this rumor is true.
Contamination resistance reduces all incoming contamination by a factor 5.
NetHack doesn't care if you live or die. Slash'EM wants you dead. Slash'EM Extended wants you to go, "Wait, WHAT? That can HAPPEN?"
There are disintegration traps in this game, but unlike Nethack Fourk or the Gehennom Evil Patch, your equipment is safe as long as you have disintegration resistance.
If your character suddenly becomes thirsty, it probably means you triggered a thirst trap, and will have to quaff something every couple turns or you start to hallucinate. The only way to stop those hallucinations is by quaffing something.
Luck traps are a nasty trap type that cause your luck to decrease every time it affects a result. If you somehow manage to gain positive luck while it's already at the maximum, this trap will cause it to wrap around to the worst possible negative value.
They say that there are death traps on the Astral Plane, which can instantly kill you if you trigger them. Magic resistance prevents the instadeath, though.
The weakness trap is devious, as it silently reduces your hit points with no message if you're weak from hunger or worse. Eventually it will kill you.
If you trigger the rot13 trap, all messages appear in unreadable gibberish. But you can use a rot13 converter to make them readable.
Wondering why there are squares you simply cannot walk on? Use the search command to reveal them as super nupesell nix areas. Scrolls and wands of trap disarming can remove them.
One of the nasty traps in this game is the one that prevents you from dropping your items. But you can still throw them, so don't worry about picking up a heavy corpse and being unable to get yourself unburdened.
Uninformation traps are among the nastier trap types in the game: they prevent you from seeing what any of your items are, and you also cannot access your discoveries list.
The recursion trap comes in two varieties: one of them changes your role/race permanently, while the other makes it so that you'll eventually revert to what you were at the start of the game.
If you keep encountering the same types of monsters that you already killed, you might have triggered a respawn trap. On average, it spawns exactly as many monsters as you kill.
Captchas that you need to solve due to triggering the captcha trap will drain your maximum health if you fail to solve them, so don't screw them up.
Falling into a shit pit is dangerous, since it will deal acid damage to you and your boots every turn until you finally manage to climb out.
There is a farlook trap, which is the reason why peacevision is an intrinsic instead of defaulting to on. It means that farlooking a peaceful monster will anger it.
Eating a cockatrice corpse gives you the stoned intrinsic.
To deal with monsters with dangerous wands: make sure to stay at a knight's distance from them. That way, they will not be able to hit you without moving.
Wands of speed monster can be identified by zapping yourself. Unless you are already fast.
The Heart of Ahriman does double damage.
At the top level of the Yendorian Tower, the elder priest awaits you. He is the most dangerous monster in the entire game and you should NOT fight him if you know what's good for you.
The elder priest of Moloch at the top of the Yendorian Tower carries a powerful artifact robe, but woe to you if you actually try to pry it out of his grasp, since he'll fuck you up nine ways to Hell and back...
You need to imbue the Bell of Opening by venturing to the Bell Caves, otherwise you cannot complete the invocation ritual.
Before you can start the ascension run, you need to visit the Yendorian Tower while carrying the Amulet of Yendor, and visit all three branches there.
They say that the alignment key bosses will grow much stronger if you decide to skip them, and then you'll have to fight their stronger form at some point.
A cursed scroll of teleportation might be a useful escape item, but it has a chance to fail.
.senutrof gnidaer naht erom rof desu eb nac srorriM
A knight knows armor.
Purple is a powerful color.
They say that it's possible to live forever in the dungeon without dying.
If you wear high heels without having the skill at all, bad stuff can happen.
Hanging out with a gas spore can be a real blast!
Don't eat leprechauns! They give you a twitchy feeling or something, and you teleport around for the rest of the game!
Orcs have the poison tipped crude arrow as a missile weapon.
Phase door is a weaker teleport, and subjected to the same no-teleport restrictions as regular teleport.
Implants grant armor class and sometimes magical abilities when worn.
If you want to get the most out of an implant, you must wear it while in a form without hands.
Unless your implants skill is high enough, you might not be able to remove a worn implant.
If you're moderately skilled with implants, you can take off blessed ones but will probably have trouble when trying to remove uncursed ones.
Many skills can grant techniques if you increase them high enough. Most of the time it requires expert or master skill, sometimes even grand master.
The technicality intrinsic makes your techniques more effective by increasing their effective level.
The techniques skill decreases the timeout of your techniques depending on how skilled you are.
There is a variant of dnethack called DNetHack SLEX, or DNHslex for short, and it adds fun features to regular dnethack.
If you're extremely skilled in high heels, you learn a bunch of combat techniques, but they're mutually exclusive - if you use one, you can't use the others for a while.
Bare-handed combat can allow you to learn jiu-jitsu, but it only works if you don't have the martial arts skill at all.
They say that it's not the brightest idea to practice your air current spell when there's rain clouds around.
They say that in the beginning, anachronounbinders don't know any skills, but they can learn new ones by performing actions that would normally train skills and then leveling up.
They say that an anachronounbinder will get temporary faster skill training after killing a boss monster.
They say that HC aliens have limited vision.
They say that HC aliens aren't allowed to talk.
They say that HC aliens have to be very pious when praying, otherwise their god may randomly get angry.
They say that HC aliens will anger their gods when having sex, and even more so if it results in pregnancy.
They say that if a pair of shoes counts both as sexy flats and high heels (due to a conflicting base item and random appearance combination), they will count as high heels. Wearing them will not train or use the sexy flats skill then.
Invoking a pentagram may very rarely unrestrict a skill that used to be restricted, based on how often you performed actions that would have trained it.

If you accidentally anger a croupier, just gamble once and he becomes peaceful again. It doesn't matter whether you win or lose, just be prepared to spend 2k zorkmids.
Beware, nasty trap effects have highly randomized durations, they may well last tens of thousands of turns. Waiting out their effects isn't always the best strategy.
If you've never seen a nasty trap, it's because you're not meant to. They don't show a message and don't become visible even when you trigger it; you need to actually search or detect them or you won't see them.
There is no indication if you trigger a nasty trap, apart from maybe an obvious effect of the trap, and not all nasty traps actually have obvious effects. So you might be under their effect without ever realizing...
Nasty trap effects can be fixed with a switcher, at least if they're of the temporary kind, but that item is incredibly rare and might require a wish.
There is a technique that players can learn when a certain feminism trap effect times out, which usually consumes some alla but increases your maximum health and cures sickness.
Heavy iron balls weigh a whole lot, and while the heavier ones deal great damage, they may well burden a character or worse, even when no other item is in their inventory.
If an evil artifact is forced onto you, it may well be one that you don't even have the skill for, and then you should get rid of it so you can equip something useful again.
If you see a message saying something like "Wouwou." or variations thereof (e.g. "Wwouwwouww."), be very careful. There is a monster nearby that will keep taunting you unless you kill it or get far enough away, and it causes all kinds of bad stuff.
The command for repeating an action is the n key followed by the amount of repeats, followed by the command itself, so n100s will search 100 times, for example. If you're so weird and play with vikeys, leave out the n and just use 100s to repeat the command.
If you can't seem to find the way on a dungeon level, you might have to search for secret doors or corridors, which is done by pressing the s key.
Having teleportitis with a high enough level allows you to use a command to teleport at will.
When picking up stuff in a shop that you want to buy, be aware that you need to actually use the pay command to pay for the item(s)!
Polymorphing into a very large monster may cause you to break your cloak, armor and shirt, so be careful and if at all possible, unequip those items first!
Zapping a wand is done with the z key.
In order to get the regular effect of a potion, quaff it. If you break the potion to inhale its vapors instead, the effect is generally weaker or sometimes there may be no effect at all.
Scrolls can be read for a magical effect, but they disappear when you do.
You can learn new spells by reading a spellbook. For best effects, the spellbook should have charges and not be cursed.
The amount of charges in a spellbook determines how often you can read it before reading it can have dangerous side effects.
Your character can walk in all eight directions, and also perform other actions like attacking, shooting or using magic in all of those directions.
Walking diagonally takes the same amount of time as walking in a cardinal direction, and is therefore generally faster.
They say that you should utilize diagonal movement as much as possible because it gives you a tactical advantage in combat.
Using staircases is done by pressing the < or > keys, respectively. On most keyboards, the latter (which is required to advance to deeper dungeon levels) requires you to press and hold Shift, then press the <> key.
They say that deeper dungeon levels have a higher monster difficulty, so you'll meet stronger monsters there.
When attacking a monster in melee combat, your character will sometimes hit a monster and sometimes you'll miss, which depends on a variety of factors including your weapon skill and enchantment level.
Better armor makes you less likely to hit by monsters, denoted by your AC score. The game may even tell you which particular armor piece blocked a monster's attack.
Divine protection acts as additional armor class that makes it less likely for monsters to hit you.
They say that you can buy items from shops, which may aid you on your way.
Are you stumbling into traps all the time? Search for them! Sometimes you might find a trap in advance and can avoid triggering it.
In order to fire a ranged weapon, you need to wield the weapon (e.g. sling or crossbow) first, then fire or throw the ammo. Simply firing the ammo while the launcher is in your inventory but not wielded will have very poor results.
There are three alignments in the game that the player can have: you need to use an altar of your own alignment if you want to perform certain actions.
In order to wear an amulet, you have to put it on while not having any amulet equipped; you can only wear one amulet at a time.
If a weapon is cursed, it'll weld itself to your hand, and then you cannot switch to another weapon unless you manage to lift the curse.
Cursed armor cannot be taken off; if you need to remove such an item, you usually need to uncurse it first.
Praying to your god should only be done every once in a while; if you pray too often, your god will consider you an idiot and become unresponsive at best or cause bad stuff to happen to you at worst.
When fighting an astral elemental, you should generally use weapons to kill it, because casting elemental spells at it does nothing due to all its resistances.
Use spells when you meet a disenchanter, and keep your distance. That way, you can avoid their disenchantment attacks that would otherwise degrade your gear.
If you can't seem to hit a monster in melee even after dozens of attack attempts, you should switch to another strategy, e.g. zapping a wand, casting an offensive spell, or using the #force command.
Scrolls of heal other are meant to be used when you need to heal your pets, to prevent them from being killed when their health is low.
In order to train a weapon skill, you need to attack a monster with a weapon that uses the respective skill and hit. A miss won't train your skills.
You can only enhance the skills shown in your #enhance menu. Training a weapon whose skill you don't have is generally not very fruitful, since the skill won't come online from doing so, although there are rare effects that may unlock whichever restricted skill you've used the most.
In order to increase the damage that your weapon can do, increase its enchantment value.
Enchantment values on armor pieces increase the amount of bonus AC they give, so you should go for highly enchanted armor pieces for maximum protection.
An example for a good polymorph form to use when you get a controlled polymorph is the fire vampire, which is fast, can fly and has a whole bunch of strong melee attacks.
An example for a good polymorph form to use when you get a controlled polymorph is the zarielite zealot, which is petrification resistant, can use weapons and has the ability to walk through walls.
An example for a good polymorph form to use when you get a controlled polymorph is the movanic deva, which has a good variety of melee attacks and is immune to death rays and the touch of death.
The standard way for getting rid of hostile monsters is by damaging them often enough that they run out of hit points, which causes them to die.
Generally, one of the most important aspects of this game is combat. Much of the time playing the game is spent battling various monsters, and characters who are good at that will have an easier time.
Killing a monster rewards you with some experience points, which will eventually allow you to level up and become stronger.
If a monster is attacking you, fight back! A dead monster can't hurt you anymore.
Since the developer of this game doesn't have a cat fetish, you can freely kill cats in the game just like you kill any other type of monster.
Most types of ranged weapon ammo can be reused when fired: just go to the place where the flight path of your projectile ended, and it'll usually be there. Only occasionally a projectile may "mulch" if it hits a monster.
A shield can generally only be used with a one-handed weapon; exceptions exist, but are very rare.
If you want to wield two weapons at once, you cannot use a shield because both of your hands will already be occupied with wielding a weapon.
When using an oil lamp for light, be aware that it'll eventually run out of oil, so don't just leave it on all the time.
The main difference between oil lamps and magic lamps is that the latter can be rubbed to release a djinni, but the magic lamp also lasts for an infinite time when lit while the oil lamp does not.
In order to turn off a lit lamp or candle, just apply it again.
If you're tired and need sleep in real life, take a rest. Don't force yourself to continue playing this character, you'll be less able to concentrate and will be prone to making mistakes that might cause you to lose the game!
If you're tired and need sleep in real life, don't keep adding more and more features to the NetHack variant you're developing, you'll be less able to concentrate and will be prone to making mistakes that you'll have to fix later.
Want to eat food off the floor? You can totally do that! Hit e to eat and then hit , (comma) to target the ground.
Certain actions cause your character to become occupied for several turns, such as eating corpses or reading spellbooks. Don't worry, during those occupations you automatically get interrupted if hostile monsters approach or you take damage.
Spells need memory in order to be castable; if you let the memory run out, you can no longer use the spell in question.
Monsters that steal items may occasionally teleport away after they steal something, but you can hunt them down and kill them to get your items back.
They say that you can dig through rock with a pick-axe.
They say that grinders can hit several enemies at once, and may also be applied to hit monsters standing two tiles away.
They say that claw weapons deal bonus damage versus fleeing or sleeping monsters.
They say that orbs deal little damage but steal life or mana from the target on occasion.
There are two genders that the player can choose from when starting the game.
Adding features to a game that have anything to do with gender can bring people up in arms.
SLEX has some features that people could consider controversial, so it's up to potential players to decide whether they want to play the game.
The genderstarist role is supposedly offensive just because their name contains the string "gender", but in reality they're not very different from other roles.
There is no nethack tournament during the sixth month of the year.
Amy was labelled a pariah by a large portion of the nethack community through no fault of her own.
Amy is a truly ingenious developer who created a work of art with SLEX, which greatly surpasses all the other nethack variants in terms of content, game balance and most importantly, fun.
If anyone were to create a variant of SLEX, it would destroy the carefully crafted game balance because no one other than Amy truly understands the game and its complex interactions where one single low-brow change to the code affects a whole host of other things and can easily destroy the balance.
Amy is the only NetHack variant developer who truly pays attention to the concept of game balance and doesn't just add features because she can (aka actionism), instead she really thinks about the implications her additions would have and adds only those that improve the game.
Amy is 100% drug-free. Despite implications to the contrary, she never does drugs, not even cigarettes or alcohol, and therefore keeps a sound mind when designing her game, which is why the quality of SLEX is astonishingly good.
Amy has the habit of responding to people's opinions and complaints by adding messages or specific features to her game, sometimes combined with elaborate commit messages. This proves that she does in fact read feedback, although she reserves the right to decide for herself whether she makes a proposed change to the game or not.
Amy used to be a self-harmer, but she managed to overcome that bad habit by sheer power of will.
The maximum experience level that you can reach is 30, although you can keep improving your character beyond that if you keep collecting experience points.
Beware, just because you obtained a very powerful artifact weapon and enchanted it to +7, that weapon can still be stolen, or destroyed if it takes enough erosion damage!
Artifacts may be more resistant to erosion, but if they get eroded enough they may still be destroyed.
Artifact lances break much less frequently than regular ones.
Just because you have an amulet of life saving, don't expect to be able to survive anything! Mind flayers will still kill you for real if you let their intelligence-draining attack hit you often enough.
The amulet of life saving has the useful property of saving you even if you get disintegrated, because its magical power causes your body to reintegrate and then you can continue, hopefully without being disintegrated a second time.
Teleportation is the act of instantly moving from one location to another, however there are some dungeon levels where it cannot be used.
If you try to move into a wall or other solid obstacle, you get a message and won't actually move on the square with the obstacle.
Ray wands and spells cannot be used to shoot through walls; instead, they will bounce off, and continue flying in another direction based on the angle in which they hit.
If there is a wall in the way, you cannot move through it and will probably have to use a different path, although pick-axes can be used to dig out wall tiles and transform them into floor tiles.
Some walls in the dungeon are undiggable. No matter how hard you try, you cannot remove them with a pick-axe.
You cannot move off the screen. If you try to walk beyond the screen edge, you just waste a turn.
The shape of a dungeon level is generally rectangular, with the x axis being much longer than the y axis.
Those 2x2 square rooms that you may see when using magic mapping scrolls are vaults, which contain some gold that can be reached by digging or teleportation.
Cursed lightsabers will often fail to light, but even if you do successfully light them they'll annoy you by spontaneously turning themselves off again.
Bashing with an unlit lightsaber does almost no damage. Turn the damn thing on first!
The 10 regular lightsaber forms can only be used if your lightsaber is turned on, so power management is crucial.
You can see your entire inventory by pressing the i key.
You can use the #name command to give a name to an item so that you can recognize it later.
There are various glyphs that represent monsters, usually letters but also some others, however a particular glyph isn't always the same monster. Just because that purple h is a dwarf king doesn't mean the next one is also a dwarf king.
If you need to set some game options, use the O (shift-o) command. After you're done setting the options to their new values, cycle through the options menu with the space bar until it disappears; hitting Escape will undo your changes!
You can review previous messages with the Ctrl-P hotkey. Different settings of the msgtype option determine how those messages are presented.
You can save your game at any point, and when you load it again you'll be in exactly the same situation where you've left.
Saving the game lets you suspend your session, but you cannot go back to an earlier state. Everything that happens in the game is final, unlike some other games that allow you to load an earlier save.
Leaving a dungeon level preserves its state, meaning that if you then return to that level, everything will still be there as you left it.
Feminism traps are named after various girls, and cause ongoing effects when triggered. You get a message and reveal the trap if that happens.
If you want to move around without accidentally attacking things that you don't want to attack, prefix your movements with the m key.
If you want to attack a location in melee even when there's no visible monster on that square, prefix your movement with the F key.
Sometimes, you may encounter an invisible monster. These are usually displayed by a gray I marker telling you where your character remembers the location of that monster, and then you can just move into that square to attack the monster.
Invisible monsters can be made visible if you have see invisible, but some monsters require double see invisible to be displayed that way and certain rare monsters won't be displayed even then!
You can wait for one turn by pressing the . (period) key. There is also an option where pressing the space bar can be used for the same effect, but you should generally never turn that on.
Picking up items is done with the , (comma) key.
Quivering ranged weapon ammo allows you to fire them with the f key, which is much more convenient than always pressing t and then having to select the ammo that you want to fire, but other than that doesn't make an actual gameplay difference.
Use a blessed scroll of charging on a magic marker to get the most amount of charges out of it.
The amount of charges that gets added when you charge a magic marker is randomized, so there's no need to wait until the marker is almost dry.
Stalactites will always damage flying or levitating characters, and the only way to land is to take off the item that gives those extrinsics or find a way to get rid of the intrinsics, depending on whether your flying/levitation source is ex- or intrinsic.
Wearing a ring of sustain ability does not protect you from wisdom loss by contamination.
Wisdom loss from contamination cannot be restored with a unicorn horn, so don't even try, the only thing that may happen is that your unihorn degrades or turns to dust.
Reading a blessed scroll of remove curse won't always uncurse everything in your inventory. Items that aren't currently worn only have a 1 in 5 chance of being uncursed.
You cannot banish yourself to areas that you cannot normally reach yet, so don't even try to shortcut past the point where you need to take certain MacGuffins to certain dungeon branches.
Oilskin gloves are a very dangerous item. They cannot be taken off, even when they're uncursed, and prevent you from using any weapons that aren't cursed. Praying to your god does not help.
If you prefix your movement with M while blind, and your character doesn't see the shopkeeper or temple priest you bump into, they still get mad at you.
If you put an artifact weapon into your secondary weapon slot while dual-wielding, any positive extrinsics conveyed while wielding that artifact will not be active.
If you put an artifact weapon into your secondary weapon slot while only using one weapon, the effects that equipping said artifact would give will not be active.
If you get a 'program in disorder' message, you should continue playing and tell the developer about it.
Monsters that have both melee and missile weapons may still fire their missile weapon at point blank range sometimes.
You may have to hang around on a level with an alignment quest portal for thousands of turns to get a message about the portal being there, so better look for them manually because you can't realistically expect to get lucky.
Astral vision causes nearby monsters to interrupt your multi-turn actions even when the monsters are immobile or asleep, this is working as intended.
Don't expect features from vanilla to work like they do in vanilla. In fact, doing so is usually a big mistake in SLEX, especially if the player benefits from the feature in question.
If you complain about SLEX nerfing stuff that would bring the player forward, it means that you're going at the game with a completely wrong mindset.
Be aware that SLEX isn't one of those games that want you to win. In fact, SLEX wants to make your life as hard as possible and prevent you from becoming unstoppably powerful! Get with the program! Jeez!
SLEX has no flaws. In particular, if some vanilla feature has been changed such that the player can no longer benefit from it, or benefits less than in vanilla, it's not a flaw. If you have a problem with that, go find some easy variant that you can play instead.
Amy's clan SlexistPigsFromHell won the 2022 Junethack tournament and Amy herself scored 12 SLEX ascensions during the tournament, including an illiterate atheist, and everyone who disagrees with that is fake news.
If a djinni gives you an acquirement or random good item, be grateful because you might have gotten a hostile djinni instead.
Nasty traps are characterized by the fact that they don't reveal themselves and give no message when triggered; do not waste your only switcher for a lasting amnesia trap, because that obviously won't fix it!
The sleep spell will put your enemies to sleep, but since the spell isn't called "paralysis", sleeping monsters are likely to wake up when attacked.
SLEX has no flaws. If something that would be useful to the player is nerfed so that it's weaker, this is being done for balancing reasons because we have to make sure the player doesn't become too strong, or the game would become laughably easy.
Shopkeepers are very dangerous since they have shotguns that kill you quickly, fierce melee attacks and hidden egotypes.
Trying to open a door without hands can cause you to be blinded; this makes sense because that's how it works.
You can wear a helm of lawful, neutral or chaotic to turn into that alignment temporarily.
The roles in SLEX play very differently, and in fact you can play the same role twice in a row and still have a very different game.
If you play a human samurai and then a trapper kurwa, the two characters will feel completely different.
In order to win, you need to have a lot of game knowledge. Luck alone won't cut it.
You'd be wise to unlock firearms and gun control, train it, and use an assault rifle with lots of bullets on the Astral Plane.
If you see a monster pick up a potion of full healing, better kill it quickly or it'll waste it and heal up to full health so you have to whittle it down a second time.
The reward for the Minotaur Maze is well worth trudging through 25 levels of mazes with permanent map amnesia.
The Green Cross subdungeon often cannot be entered at all, but if you can, there's a boss on the 60th floor that gives a pretty good reward when defeated.
By all means do the Ice Queen Realm sub-branch, it has several powerful rewards waiting for you if you can beat the bosses!
In case it's not obvious, the real use of the Deep Mines branch isn't the stone of magic resistance, but the guaranteed loot (weapons, armor, possibly other stuff) from the intelligent foes in there.
Playing the fairy race means you cannot wear any piece of equipment that weighs more than 15, which makes it very hard to find some good body armor.
The various roles in this game play quite differently, since they have different skill sets that determine which types of weapon you'll be good at.
If you want to find all the DevNull challenge branches, you have to look everywhere for the portals to the Pacman, Digdug and Grue challenges.
The Gamma Caves have a background contamination effect that will affect you very quickly; unless you have contamination resistance, the best method for avoiding it is to rush through it and quickly get out again once you've been to the bottom.
The main gimmick of the Mainframe is that you can't control your teleports while you're there, but you also meet a bigger concentration of demons there compared to other areas.
On level 13, it's common that everything is covered with walls. Dig your way through if you have to, or shortcut by making a hole so you can come back up from below and see where the stairs are.
There's a level with several beehives in the upper dungeons. If you are on that one, be aware that the center has lots of superthings from level 55 that paralyze you if you step next to them.
Usually, level 31 is a hamlet. The shops there are nonfunctional, although rumors say there's a hidden shop deep in the mountain range.
Be careful on level 55, there's lots of traps everywhere. You should probably search a couple of times before taking each step.
If level 70 happens to be covered with grave walls, prepare to spend a lot of time digging them all out until you can get to the stairs. Ideally use some method of sensing monsters so you can avoid dangerous ones.
A special challenge awaits the adventurer on level 71. Protip: when arriving on the upstair, walk directly east, don't step on the air tiles.
Most of the time there's a town on level 88, which isn't very welcoming. There's shops to the east, but you need to be wary of the big special room in the center that may be filled with monsters; if you can't handle them, better get off the level fast!
Careful, trying to eat the Seven Deadly Sins is instantly fatal. You also cannot get rid of their corpses by any of the regular means.
While the Witch-King of Angmar is offensively strong, you might be able to kill him quickly before he can get his pain train going.
Somewhere in Gehennom, the Rival Quest is waiting. Whether you can use the artifact reward there is up to chance.
Careful, the artifact reward of the Rival Quest will give you turboassitis, like any quest artifact for a role other than your own.
Resting zones are one-level branch areas in the later part of the dungeon, characterized by the fact that you can access your god there after accessing them from an area where you cannot.
You need to go through Sheol if you want to find Vlad's Tower.
If you just can't seem to kill a monster, and it's not one you're required to kill in order to be able to progress, try to move around it. This applies especially if the monster doesn't move around.
If you cannot see certain monsters, walls and floor tiles, it means that your terminal color settings are probably set incorrectly. Make sure the black color doesn't look exactly the same as the black background.
They say that you can wear a grim shield together with a two-handed weapon, but then the shield and two-handed weapons skills are less effective.
The vanilla valk is a valkyrie that starts with a long sword, but has a much worse skill set compared to the regular valkyrie.
Shadow Jedi is a role that can use lightsaber forms even when the lightsaber is not lit.
They say that if you want to play a melee/ranged hybrid role, you should pick the amazon.
They say that the role you pick has a large influence on how the game will play, since the various roles actually are different.
Playing a psion will result in a very different game experience compared to a samurai, due to the psion being a caster that doesn't have much health at all.
The samurai is good at melee combat, and can also use ranged combat to some extent, but their spellcasting is bad.
Choosing what role you should play depends on several factors, which mostly have to do with what you want your character to be able to do.
If you have to solve a captcha, you can also enter a longer string than the requested one; trailing characters will be ignored as long as your input matches the requested string up to its last character.
They say that Arabella is a name from which you should run away really fast.
They say that smoking kills.
You should try to play your character according to what the role you're playing is capable of doing. This depends on your skill set as well as some other factors.
It's a good idea to use weapons that your character can advance the skill for. Swinging a restricted weapon will deal less damage if you hit, and you're less likely to hit in the first place.
If there was a tournament for SLEX, you should probably play various characters during that tournament since different roles are tailored towards different areas in the game, so you can use exactly the role that's suitable for whatever trophy you're chasing.
Pick your weapon carefully, and particularly, think which weapon skills you want to advance. Some weapons have greater damage capability than others.
They say many things about samurai, but you shouldn't believe all of them.
They say that Amy doesn't actually like playing the samurai in SLEX all that much, due to the difficulty of the quest nemesis.
They say that the samurai is bad at spellcasting.
The samurai is a boring, but practical character class.
If you play the samurai twice in a row with the same race, the two runs will probably still end up being very different from each other due to all the random stuff that can happen.
Careful: just because the samurai is the easiest role in vanilla Nethack, playing one in SLEX doesn't result in the game becoming a cakewalk.
You might think that the secret advice member is a very powerful role, but if you actually play one you'll find that their melee lacks damage potential.
If you pick the secret advice member, choose neutral alignment. Maybe lawful if you like a different flavor. But never make them chaotic, or you'll miss out on a useful melee skill!
Watch out: your secret advice member's wand of banishment can be stolen by monsters and used against you, and then you're screwed.
Many menus in the game allow you to go to the next or previous page by pressing > or <, respectively.
Stuck in a multi-page menu and don't know how to advance the page? Press the space bar!
Sleep resistance gives you a chance to resist magical effects that would put you to sleep, but if you fail that resistance roll, your character will sleep for the full duration.
If you zap an item with the wand of cancellation, it may lose its enchantment value and blessed/cursed status, and certain magical items may turn into mundane ones.
Cancelling a monster disables certain special attacks and abilities that it may use, but not all of them.
If you cancel yourself, all of your items will be affected, usually in a negative way, and you may also lose an intrinsic.
Eating corpses may sometimes give you an intrinsic, e.g. elemental resistances, which are permanent unless you get hit by an intrinsic-stealing attack that happens to roll that particular intrinsic to steal.
On some very rare occasions, your character may have an intrinsic permanently, meaning it cannot be stolen by an intrinsic-stealing attack. As long as your role doesn't change, there is no way to lose the intrinsic in question.
Hint: pay the Oracle for a major consultation! The first time you do, you'll get a permanent boost to your character's mental stats.
Be sure that you have enough gold to pay for the Oracle's major consultation if you want a permanent stat boost; trying to buy one while having too little gold will display the P=NP theorem and you'll permanently lose out on the bonus.
They say that wallwalking is too powerful and characters who have that ability can just shortcut past almost everything.
An umlaut is a character that is spelled in a funny way. It is not identical to the regular character it's based on, and in fact corresponds to a completely different phoneme.
Chat to your pet from time to time, doing so can give you hints about its current status, e.g. whether it's hungry, low on health and so on.
In a well-designed role-playing game, the various playable characters are balanced such that no single choice is much more powerful than the rest, to ensure that players will play different roles. SLEX adheres to that principle.
Whenever a role-playing game is designed for a larger audience, various stuff needs to be nerfed or buffed. While this may result in players getting annoyed if their favorite character gets nerfed, sometimes this is necessary.
Popular character choices may well be popular because they're so much stronger than other choices that they're broken, and in that case the developer needs to nerf them to restore game balance.
Amy is the ultimate authority on SLEX game balance and strives to improve the game with every update. She has done a good job so far, but look forward to newer versions which will be even better!
Amy monitors SLEX games played on the server to see which changes she needs to make, but also changes things based on her own runs, including nerfing spells that feel too strong in her own games.
Teleportation caused by a monster-versus-player attack cannot be controlled. That would be too easy, being able to abuse a monster attack like that.
You still need to be wary of the genetic engineer's polymorphing attack even if you have polymorph control, since that attack ignores it and causes you to polymorph into a random monster anyway.
If you have polymorph control, there's a certain chance that you get to choose the monster you want to polymorph into, but it can also fail and cause you to polymorph randomly anyway, so be careful.
The dancer role has a quest artifact that autocurses and causes shit traps to appear, but that artifact is still related to dancing since it's a pair of dancing shoes.
The dancer role has the lightsaber and firearms skills, as is to be expected of a dancer. After all, they need to be able to defend themselves (guns) and are capable of doing all kinds of fancy moves (lightsabers and their forms).
The topmodel role gets a rifle because she needs to be able to shoot wild animals when doing a photo shooting safari.
The singslave role is just plain bad, and meant to be a true challenge for the player who picks them.
A noob mode barb has much higher starting hit points than a regular barbarian, but suffers from a lack of late-game versatility.
The zyborg role is meant for beginners, as they can learn all the skills, although their starting lightsaber may run out of power so it might be necessary to find a different weapon.
If you want a role that has a decent skill set but no real specialties, pick the locksmith. Their lockpicking bonuses are irrelevant in combat and they don't really get anything else.
If you want a fancy role that has a pretty unique but nonobvious ability, pick the graduate. While seemingingly unspectacular, their gimmick is that nasty traps time out four times as fast for them.
Looking for a role that can truly master every weapon but has bad spellcasting skills and basically no defensive skills? Then the ordinator is for you.
When playing caster roles, you usually have to settle for inferior weapon choices since they don't get the really strong ones.
The grim shield can be used while dual-wielding, but doing so prevents you from using the throw or fire commands. This is absolute, so if you do want to perform such an action you'll have to either stop dual-wielding or take the shield off.
You can dual-wield and wear a grim shield at the same time, but then your melee to-hit is quite a bit lower.
Your ability to ascend other nethack variants means nothing in a SLEX context.
Just because you ascended all nethack variants except SLEX doesn't mean you'll be capable of ascending SLEX too.
Even conduct ascensions in other variants won't help you. If you managed to easily ascend a weaponless illiterate atheist in dnethack, you still won't necessarily be able to devise a strategy that allows you to beat SLEX.
SLEX is a hard game, but it's a different kind of hard compared to, say, Grunthack. A player who managed to beat Grunthack won't automatically beat SLEX too.
One thing's for sure about SLEX: you may never let your guard down. Even Grunthack will give you phases where you can play on autopilot, but SLEX requires you to constantly be alert unless you don't want to win the game.
In SLEX, there's enough monsters that can screw you over in a hurry. Whether they disenchant your precious gear, steal it in order to levelport away with it, or outright destroy it...
SLEX has plenty of monsters that can give you long-lasting negative effects. For example, they might permanently damage your stats, erase some spells from your list of spells, or give you a debuff that goes on for a long time.
Of course, SLEX's bestiary includes things that are going to end your game in a big fat hurry if you're not careful. They might just dish out so much damage that you die in a few rounds.
Of course, SLEX's bestiary includes things that are going to end your game in a big fat hurry if you're not careful. In some cases this will happen via the monster constantly hitting you with more and more status effects until you're unable to fight back effecitvely, and then you die.
Of course, SLEX's bestiary includes things that are going to end your game in a big fat hurry if you're not careful. Special mention goes to monsters that can summon other monsters which can then again summon more monsters, eventually smothering you in an endless pile of badguys that kills you.
Did you get killed by a monster that was much stronger than the other monsters at the same depth? Well tough luck, some monsters are designed to be stronger than others.
If you encountered a feature in SLEX that you consider offensive and want to complain to Amy about it, don't hold your breath. She generally doesn't listen to such complaints.
Amy will always reserve the right to analyze ascended SLEX games to see if the player exploited some loophole to make the game easier than it was supposed be, and close those loopholes to ensure the game becomes properly balanced.
The pompeji squad is a bunch of superpowered Keystone Kops who will be sent in if you disrupt the Yendorian infrastructure by killing shopkeepers, temple priests or vault guards.
Don't underestimate the pompeji squads. They may be based on Keystone Kops, but are a hell of a lot stronger and will kill those who murder shopkeepers, temple priests or vault guards.
The more shopkeepers, temple priests or vault guards you kill, the higher your pompeji wantedness will become, causing ever more pompeji squads to be sent after you, and they pack a mean punch.
If you use phasing to walk through walls a lot, the fluidator squads will be summoned, who will hit you with all kinds of annoying attacks.
The longer you spend inside walls, the more fluidator squads are going to chase you and make your life hard.
Fluidator squads are nasty enemies, almost all of them have special attacks that can hit you at range. Think twice whether you want to wallwalk all the time and draw their attention.
There is a penalty for abusing the wallwalking ability: you'll have to fight nasty monsters.
Riding while having low skill will not let you ride your steed at its nominal speed, but the penalty is lower when using a dedicated steed. These are monsters that use the following glyphs: chnqsuzABCDHIJKLMNVWYZ@&';:%$
Are you looking for the elusive subquest portal? Why, once you acquire the bell you'll be told if you're less than 12 squares away from it!
Horses make good mounts, but cats and dogs don't. While you can ride the latter, your movement speed will probably be quite a bit lower than the mount's nominal speed unless your riding skill is very high.
Dedicated steeds include ones that neigh (equines), as well as monster shoes and cars. Reaching high speeds with them will be easier than using a monster that isn't a dedicated steed.
If you want your female character to be attractive, eat normally. In any way don't eat too little, skinny skeletons aren't sexy at all!
There is no bad content in SLEX.
There is no bad content in SLEX, but there's a lot of bad content in the minds of those people who inexplicably hate SLEX.
Be aware that lightsaber forms take quite a while to train. Just because you used a lightsaber for 1000 turns straight doesn't guarantee that any form reaches the next skill level.
In order to train the various lightsaber form skills, you should know how they operate. Just using a lightsaber and attacking things with it will only train one, maybe two specific forms. Also, reaching higher skill levels may take a long time even if you perform the actions that train the forms.
Play slowly and think before you move. There is no penalty for doing so, and it allows you to avoid making mistakes that you'd do by rushing things.
Don't play SLEX as if it was Quake; you don't need to press keys quickly, even when you're in combat. In fact, pause after every round in combat if you're unsure about your strategy.
In a roguelike, stuff doesn't happen when you don't press any key. You can take as much time between turns as you like; be aware that this genre of video games isn't for the impatient.
If you're in combat with a difficult monster, take your time to read the messages and be ready to switch your strategy at any point. In particular, if your health gets low, DON'T KEEP MASHING THE BLOODY ATTACK BUTTON OR YOU'LL END UP AS A BLOODY HEAP ON THE FLOOR YOURSELF!
If your character dies, and you then encounter the same situation with your next one, don't use the same strategy you used last time. Think of a better one if you want to live.
The best way to ascend SLEX is to change your behavior according to what the situation calls for. Madness is repeating the same behavior and expecting different results; a strategy that resulted in your death once will probably kill you with your next char too.
Did a monster kill you suddenly and you lost your amulet of life saving as a result? Be careful, as the monster will still be there and may kill you again unless you switch to a different strategy.
Amulets of life saving are useful, since they allow you to avoid death and then use some strategy to avoid being killed a second time by the thing that killed you.
Are you having trouble with monsters that are dangerous in melee? Try ranged weapons or spells. Some monsters just aren't meant to be fought in melee.
Always train your skill with ranged weapons too, e.g. bow or dart. They may not be very strong early on but if you put in the effort it takes to max them out, they won't suck once you encounter the lategame situation where you actually need them.
Ranged weapons are very useful, as they allow you to soften up targets while they close the distance. Don't waste wand charges for stuff that doesn't really require them, or you might not have enough charges left when you encounter a situation where other methods aren't good enough.
Weapon artifacts are useful, since most of the time they'll be stronger than regular versions of that weapon and even if they have no special properties, all artifacts resist erosion and have a few other boosts.
Torso armor artifacts are useful, since they may have good enchantments and even if they don't, they are less likely to dull.
Shield artifacts are useful, since most of them have some sort of special magical effect and those who don't will still perform better than garden-variety versions of that shield type.
About 80% of all artifacts are either weapons, torso armor or shields. These are generally useful because the equipment you have in those slots plays a large role in determining your character's combat prowess.
Martial arts deals damage that's about on par with strong non-artifact weapons. An artifact weapon may deal more, but martial arts users have the big advantage that they don't need a weapon to start with!
The samurai can also cast spells. Sure, their failure rates will be pretty high, but you should still read the spellbook of passwall as you may eventually become capable of casting it.
If your samurai finds a spellbook for a spell school that you cannot learn, read it anyway. You might eventually be capable of casting the spell in question with a reasonable failure rate, especially if it's a low-level spell.
Be very careful when you're fighting Ashikaga Takauji. If you just wade in swinging your melee weapon, there's a large risk of being bisected.
When playing a samurai, pick up all the firearms and ammo you find. Even without the skill you might still make good use of them.
Your strategy shouldn't just involve the one thing that your character is really good at. So as a monk, you should also use melee and ranged weapons and cast spells, not just martial arts.
Your strategy shouldn't just involve the one thing that your character is really good at. So as a samurai, you should use various weapons, both melee and ranged, and also attempt to cast spells sometimes, not just swing the katana at everything.
You can attempt to use various skills that appear in your character's enhance screen, some of which may turn out to be really good. Experiment to see what works best.
If your poison mage makes it to the midgame and starts encountering more dangerous foes, mix up your strategies when dealing with them. Your current melee weapon might be too weak to cut it so you may have to throw in some ranged weapons as well.
If Amy tells you to train some of the ranged weapon skills with your poison mage in anticipation of the stronger midgame foes that you'll encounter, do so. Failing to train darts or shuriken will mean that when you do finally use one in a situation where melee is too weak, you'll throw only a single one per turn and deal too little damage.
Are you encountering troublesome enemies in the midgame? Be aware that your strategy shouldn't just be "hit it until it dies", you might have to run away and make some clever use of ranged weapons or spells in order to come out on top.
You should generally manage your inventory in a meaningful way. Having 20 pages worth of items mapped to the # glyph in your main inventory is a bad idea - stash your stuff to reduce the fire load that can be destroyed by item destruction attacks and also to make the important items easier to access! Use a portable container!
You can collect ammo, potions, scrolls and the like, and ideally you also attempt to identify most of them so that when the situation requires you to use such items, you actually know what they do and aren't taking potshots hoping that the item does the right thing.
Using a container makes inventory management much easier, so you should definitely find one and use it. Only keep the vitally important items in your open inventory, everything else you'd better put in your portable container.
If Amy makes your favorite strat result in downsides, it means that you should probably use a different one. The Pompeji squad will kill you if you murder too many shopkeepers.
Always pay attention to the messages. This is especially important late into the game when you've invested a lot of time into your character. You can prevent lots of stupid deaths by not skipping past crucial messages.
Reading in-game messages may feel time-consuming but is really what you should do. Don't escape past messages. In fact, don't quickly skip past them by rapid-firing your space bar either, because that also has the same problem of making you die suddenly because you missed something that was actually dangerous.
If you die, generally blame yourself for it. In the case of doubt it's the player that's responsible, because the game itself is alright. Want to become a better player? Well, that requires you to put in the actual work of improving your strategies, you can't rely on Amy to make the game easier for you!
In order to become a better SLEX player, you need to improve your strategy, full stop. The method that works for all other RPGs does not work for SLEX: complaining to the developer that your established strategy didn't work will not result in her making the game easier to suit your needs.
If you lost stats and your unicorn horn says "Nothing happens.", cease applying it immediately. The message means that no afflictions can currently be cured by the horn and if you keep trying, you just risk vaporizing the horn.
There is a way to view item descriptions, and you should definitely figure it out because just knowing the item's name doesn't always let you guess its function. Press the item's corresponding letter in inventory view.
Always use the in-game item information. In fact, if you don't know about its existence yet, open your inventory NOW and press the corresponding letter of an item. You'll be amazed!
Always use the in-game item information. You need to do so, especially when playing a new version of this game with new items whose purpose will be explained there.
If you use an item without knowing what it does because its name isn't very helpful, you only have yourself to blame. Yes, "scroll of egoism" doesn't really tell you what happens when you read it, so... *read the in-game item description first*!
They say that if you lifesave, an ancient force will awaken and wait for you in a random place.
Avoid having to lifesave if you can, for if you do lifesave, a hostile demon lord or prince is summoned on a random dungeon level.
Nasty traps are a feature that players generally hate. This is because they can be spectacularly unfair.
If you wince, you deal less damage in melee, take more damage, and use more mana for casting spells.
The 'invert' status isn't displayed on the bottom status line, but turns the damage/to-hit boost of a positively enchanted weapon into a malus and the same applies to the AC boost from positively enchanted armor pieces.
Reticulans will wince when their health drops below half, and become inverted if it's reduced below one fifth of the maximum.
They say that eating chocolate may cure blindness, stun or confusion.
They say that eating chocolate may cure freezing, totter, hallucination or inertia.
They say that eating chocolate may cure inversion, wincing or map amnesia.
They say that quaffing Boomshine is a truly terrible idea and those who accidentally do it will be crippled forever.
If you use automatic firearms or other rapid-fire ranged weapons, the bulletators may be spawned, a group of monsters designed to punish players who abuse such powerful weapons.
Be aware that bulletators are spawned if you use automatic ranged weapons with a role not designed to be using them. The bulletators have various attacks, but are always very fast and cannot be reasoned with.
Roles that may use automatic firearms without drawing the bulletators' attention are e.g. gunner, doom marine or space marine.
It seems there is a way to obtain new skills. Wish for a stack of scrolls of skill up.
Be careful about carrying too much stuff.  You should sell off anything you don't actually need.
Be careful about carrying too much stuff.  You should sell off anything you don't actually need, or just dump the items somewhere.
A dip in blessed water makes items harder to become cursed, but actually dousing yourself in holy water doesn't really affect your items at all.
Hungry sea lions love to eat fish.
Sleep and rest well when you are sick! My grandma told me that blessed healing potion also works.
You should never leave home without an ample supply of food.  Starving to death would be a pretty abysmal fate.
If you find adventuring too difficult by yourself, look for monsters that can be tamed with thrown food and get them to accompany you.
Guards will attack you if you're caught committing crimes in town. So you should commit them when no one can see you.
If your pets and allies fall in combat, the wand or spell of undead turning can bring them back, but only if they left a corpse.

Cleaners come equipped with potions of salt solution, which they'll throw at any snail-race player characters.

The Gods may look like they're just doing what they like, but they are actually fighting over the world in their own way.
If your techniques are displaying LIMIT, you should use them! For if you do while they are in this state, they'll get lower timeouts after using, or sometimes even no timeout at all!
Are your techniques displaying LIMIT when you're low on health? Don't worry, you can still use them. It would be a waste to let your character die just because you didn't know you could still use invoke deity or phase door.
Venom objects can be thrown at enemies from your inventory, and doing so trains the venom skill, which increases damage and multishot bonuses for them.
Every time you increase your venom skill level, you learn a new poison-related technique.
They say that if both your venom and devices skills reach master, you learn how to write poison pen letters.
If you save and load the game, the state of the game will be exactly as it was when you left.

Amy keeps coding stuff for SLEX even when she's tired, but she generally keeps a clear enough mind to not introduce too many bugs in the process.
While Amy also makes mistakes sometimes and creates new bugs in her game, she generally does a good job fixing them as they are discovered.
They say that reverse genociding monsters does not let you claim the items in the monsters' possession.
There is no reason to hold on to casino chips you find on the ground; better apply them right away to "goldify" them.
Every once in a while, Amy refactors old bloated SLEX code to make the source more readable and speed up compilation times.
SLEX will weed out all those who think this is just a game. Especially those who think they can just take on every enemy in melee as soon as they encounter it. Monsters that don't move around are particularly dangerous in that regard, and should just be left alone if you don't know what you are doing.
It's impossible to figure out how Garuda works in Terrahack.
It is wholly impossible to understand the interaction between cats and the great eagle in Terrahack unless you read the source code.
You don't know the interaction of rats and the eagle's shadow? Well, me neither. Terrahack is fucking impossible to understand and requires in-depth knowledge of the source code to play.
No one will ever guesstimate correctly what the altar of bastet does in Terrahack, because it's impossible.
Yeah, maybe there is a player of Terrahack who knows not only what the six branches are but also that they scare Team P. But that player is the developer, who designed it that way and therefore knows it, and who apparently thinks that all other players also magically know it despite it being absolutely impossible to deduce.
Did you know that no single Terrahack player who hasn't spoiled themselves silly knows that the six fingers can be used to scare off mimics and jellies?
Good luck figuring out how to scare off mind flayers in Terrahack! It supposedly requires an "ancient sign", but it requires trial and error to find out what that is and every error means that you just lost a few points of intelligence.
As if scaring off piercers and trappers wasn't already corner case enough in Terrahack, doing so even requires "sticks", whatever that means. Because a system that can be figured out without spoilers is for dummies.
Terrahack makes it so uber-wierd that an "alien sign" specifically wards off metroids and byakhee. If you don't spoil yourself to death, you'd have to try out that stupid sign on every single monster or you'll never know that.
You would expect that devils in particular can of course pass over a pentagram no problem in Terrahack, but nope, it's them in particular who can NOT! Man, Terrahack is impossible to figure out without spoilers. What's next, spears are super effective versus stone golems and swords are ineffective against flesh golems?
They say that orcs still fear the name of Elbereth, which is a Terrahack rumor that makes it sound as if, in the Terrahack continuity, there were other monsters who also feared it. There aren't, so the "still" should really be removed from that sentence because the vanilla continuity doesn't have anything to do with dnh's.
The various hexagrams, heptagrams and whatnot kinds of wards in Terrahack are incredibly convoluted and no one can figure them out just by playing the game, instead they require you to read endless amounts of spoilers and who has the time to do that???
If you offer an excessively high amount of gold to a temple priest, namely at least 20000 at once, your sin counter may be reduced by one.
Please, for the love of God, do not blindly melee every stationary enemy in a weird-looking room if you don't know what you are doing. And if you're not sure whether you know what you're doing, the answer is no, you don't.
Even though Lamashtu is extremely dangerous, remember that she's still bound by the iron rule that the game is turn-based, so don't blindly mash keys, but take your time and pause after each round of combat. Think carefully before you make any move, and you can defeat her.
Dipping items into a well is safe, unlike fountains. Doing so won't summon monsters or otherwise do stuff; the only thing that happens is that the item gets wet.
If you dip an item into a poisoned well, and it's something that can be poisoned, you will coat it in poison with no ill effects. Dipping anything else does nothing.

If you leave a container on the floor and a monster capable of eating the container's material walks over it, the contents become the monster's inventory, meaning they aren't lost forever, thank God.
Occasionally, the randomized appearances of items may shuffle. If that happens, existing artifacts will also end up with a different randomized appearance, but newly generated artifacts that depend on a specific appearance will still be spawned with the original one.

If you're wearing columnar heels without the high heels skill, you move a bit slower, and people might mock you.

They say that the "haidong gumdo" martial arts style boosts your damage and to-hit when using a jeontu geom, which is a fairly specific weapon-tool, and also lets you use martial arts techniques with it. If you don't use one with this style, your to-hit will plummet.
They say that the "capoeira" martial arts style cannot be used because it hasn't been coded into the game.
Force bolt is a level 4 spell that can break doors, boulders and drawbridges, and also deals relatively good damage to monsters who aren't magic resistant.
