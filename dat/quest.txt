%Cc Arc 00001
You are suddenly in familiar surroundings.  The buildings in the distance
appear to be those of your old alma mater, but something is wrong.  It looks
as if there has been a riot recently, or %H has
been under siege.

All of the windows are boarded up, and there are objects scattered around
the entrance.

Strange forbidding shapes seem to be moving in the distance.
%E
%Cp Arc 00002
Once again, you are back at %H.
%E
%Cp Arc 00003
You are back at %H.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Arc 00005
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00006
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00007
"Did you see the artifact %l brought back from the last dig?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00008
"So what species do *you* think we evolved from?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00009
"So you're %ls prize pupil!  I don't know what he sees in you."
%E
%Cp Arc 00010
"Did you see Lash LaRue in 'Song of Old Wyoming' the other night?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00011
"Hey man, got any potions of hallucination for sale?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00012
"I guess you are guaranteed to make full professor now."
%E
%Cp Arc 00013
"So, what was worse, %n or your entrance exams?"
%E
%Cp Arc 00014
"%oC is impressive, but nothing like the bones I dug up!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00015
"Finally you have returned, %p.  You were always
my most promising student.  Allow me to see if you are ready for the
most difficult task of your career."
%E
%Cp Arc 00016
"Again, %p, you stand before me.
Let me see if you have gained experience in the interim."
%E
%Cp Arc 00017
"Once more, %p, you have returned from the field.
Are you finally ready for the task that must be accomplished?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00018
"%p, you have failed us.  All of my careful training has been in
vain.  Begone!  Your tenure at this college has been revoked!

"You are a disgrace to the profession!"
%E
%Cc Arc 00019
"%p, you are yet too inexperienced to undertake such a demanding
quest.  A mere %r could not possibly face the rigors demanded and
survive.  Go forth, and come here again when your adventures have further
taught you."
%E
%Cc Arc 00020
"%pC!  I've heard that you've been using sloppy techniques.  Your
results lately can hardly be called suitable for %ra!

"How could you have strayed from the %a path?  Go from here, and come
back only when you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Arc 00021
"Grave times have befallen the college, for %na has
stolen %o.  Without it, the board of directors of
the university will soon have no choice but to revoke our research grants.

"You must locate the entrance to %i.  Within it,
you will find %n.

"You must then defeat %n and return %o
to me.

"Only in this way will we be able to prevent the budget cuts that could
close this college.

"May the wisdom of %d be your guide."
%E
%Cp Arc 00025
"Beware, for %n is powerful and cunning."
%E
%Cp Arc 00026
"To locate the entrance to %i, you must pass
many traps."
%E
%Cp Arc 00027
"A %nt may be vulnerable to attacks by magical cold."
%E
%Cp Arc 00028
"Call upon %d when you encounter %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00029
"You must destroy %n.  It will pursue you otherwise."
%E
%Cp Arc 00030
"%oC is a mighty talisman.  With it you
can destroy %n."
%E
%Cp Arc 00031
"Go forth with the blessings of %d."
%E
%Cp Arc 00032
"I will have my %gP watch for your return."
%E
%Cp Arc 00033
"Remember not to stray from the true %a path."
%E
%Cp Arc 00034
"You may be able to sense %o when you are near."
%E
%Cc Arc 00035
A plain opens before you.  Beyond the plain lies a foreboding edifice.

You have the feeling that you will soon find the entrance to
%i.
%E
%Cp Arc 00036
Once again, you are near the entrance to %i.
%E
%Cc Arc 00040
A strange feeling washes over you, and you think back to things you
learned during the many lectures of %l.

You realize the feeling must be the presence of %o.
%E
%Cp Arc 00041
The familiar presence of %o is in the ether.
%E
%Cc Arc 00050
"So, %p, you think that you can succeed in recovering
%o, when your teacher, %l, has already failed.

"Come, try your best!  I shall destroy you, and gnaw on your bones."
%E
%Cc Arc 00051
"Again you try to best me, eh %p?  Well, you shall fail again.

"You shall never recover %o.

"I shall bear your soul to the Plane of Origins for my master's pleasure."
%E
%Cp Arc 00052
"You persist yet %p!  Good.  Now, you shall die!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00053
"I shall have %o from you, %p, then feast
upon your entrails!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00060
"Try your best, %p.  You cannot defeat me."
%E
%Cp Arc 00061
"I shall rend the flesh from your body whilst you still breathe!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00062
"First you, %p, then I shall destroy your mentor, %l."
%E
%Cp Arc 00063
"Tiring yet, %p?  I draw my power from my master and cannot
falter!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00064
"I shall rend thy soul from thy body and consume it!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00065
"You are far too %a -- it weakens you.  You shall die in this place."
%E
%Cp Arc 00066
"%d has forsaken you!  You are lost now!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00067
"A mere %r cannot hope to defeat me!"
%E
%Cp Arc 00068
"If you are the best %l can send, I have nothing to fear."
%E
%Cp Arc 00069
"Die %c!  I shall exhibit your carcass as a trophy."
%E
%Cc Arc 00070
The power of %o flows through your body!  You feel
as if you could now take on the Wizard of Yendor himself and win, but
you know you must return %o to %l.
%E
%Cp Arc 00080
The body of %n dissipates in a cloud of noxious fumes.
%E
%Cc Arc 00081
%lC touches %o briefly, gazes into it,
then smiles at you and says:

"Well done, %p.  You have defeated %n and
recovered %o.  But I fear that it shall never be safe
here.

Please take %o with you.  You, %p, can
guard it now far better than I.

May the blessings of %d follow you and guard you."
%E
# assumes Orb of Detection (glass object)
%Cc Arc 00082
"Careful, %p!  %oC might break, and that would be
a tragic loss.  You are its keeper now, and the time has come to
resume your search for the Amulet.  %Z await your
return through the magic portal that brought you here."
%E
%Cc Arc 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  Have you progressed with your quest to
regain the Amulet of Yendor for %d?"
%E
%Cc Arc 00091
"Congratulations, %p.  I wondered if anyone could prevail against
the Wizard and the minions of Moloch.  Now, you must embark on one
final adventure.

"Take the Amulet, and find your way onto the astral plane.
There you must find the altar of %d and sacrifice the
Amulet on that altar to fulfill your destiny.

"Remember, your path now should always be upwards."
%E
%Cc Arc 00095
"You have betrayed all those who hold allegiance to %d, as you once did.
My allegiance to %d holds fast and I cannot condone or accept what you 
have done.

Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at %H again.
That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.
%E

%Cp Arc 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!
Look for a ...ic transporter.
You couldn't quite make out that last message.
%E
%Cp Arc 00101
You again sense %l pleading for help.
%E
%Cp Arc 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E

%Cc Arc 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Arc 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos subdungeons.
%E
%Cc Arc 00105
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Dead Grounds.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Forging Chamber and Ordered Chaos subdungeons.
%E
%Cc Arc 00106
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Ordered Chaos.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Forging Chamber and Dead Grounds subdungeons.
%E
%Cc Arc 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Arc 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Arc 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Arc 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Arc 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Arc 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Arc 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Arc 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Arc 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Arc 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Arc 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

You enter %H, the place where your career as a spellcaster

"You are not faithful to your own deity, %p! Go away until you
have done some good deeds and then we'll talk again."
%E
%Cc Occ 00021
"Yes %p, you are ready to face %n. That evil person dared to steal
%o, our most prized artifact.

If you can kill %n, that artifact will be yours to keep. For me,
the important thing is that such a mean thief gets killed for that
crime. You will venture to %i and recover %o!"

"Ah, %p. I see you're running errands for %l.
Does that old loser and his entourage want %o back?
Because you can't have it back. You will die at my hands now,

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Occ 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Occ 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Occ 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.

"Congratulations! You are the new owner of %o now.
Your next task is to venture down to Gehennom, the Under World,
and retrieve two more powerful artifacts. Only then you can
truly save our world."

%Cc Elm 00082
"As I said, %o is yours for the keeping. Use it for a good purpose!"

"You filthy heretic! We will tolerate your existence no longer.
Leave our camp and never come back. If I ever see you again, I will kill you."
%E
%Cp Elm 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!

"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E

%Cc Elm 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Elm 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

%Cc Elm 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Elm 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Elm 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Elm 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Elm 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Elm 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Elm 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Elm 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Elm 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Elm 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be

somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Abu 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Abu 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Abu 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Abu 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Drd 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Drd 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Drd 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Drd 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Zoo 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Zoo 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Zoo 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Zoo 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be

you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Sci 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

%Cc Sci 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

Suddenly, you see yourself at the surroundings of %H.
You smile as you recognize the land, remembering of the days you lived here,
learning the power of songs over nature, before you went on your voyages 
around the world.

But, wait... something is wrong.  The land looks desolated; the beautiful
river, which flow produced a soft music, now looks dead; the breeze,
once an inspiration to the music students, makes you shiver. The nymphs are
scattered and it seems all the muses abandoned the place. You feel something

    Do not be shy, my %S; it is yours know. May %d give you wisdom

in defeating the Wizard of Yendor and his minions, it would be you.

"Go now, and take the Amulet to the astral plane.  Once there, present
the Amulet on the altar of %d.  Along the way you shall pass through the

"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E

%Cc Brd 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Brd 00104

%Cc Brd 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Brd 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Brd 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Brd 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Brd 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Brd 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Brd 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Brd 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Brd 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Brd 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete

a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Pok 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

%Cc Pok 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Pok 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Pok 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Pok 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Pok 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Pok 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Pok 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Pok 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Pok 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Pok 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

This is where you began your journey on the Dark Path of Magic.
It's the familiar sight of %H. Certainly your colleagues will be waiting

you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,

you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

%E
%Cc Ele 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!

After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Ele 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Ele 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Ele 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Ele 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles

Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at %H again.
That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.

You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!

"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E

%Cc Poi 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Poi 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the

%Cc Poi 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Poi 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.

%Cc Poi 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Poi 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Poi 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Poi 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Poi 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Poi 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Poi 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

%Cc Poi 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

This is the Tiny Hamlet, where your SPACE WARS adventures used to start.
You're here because you have to prove your skills to Marc, who is
generally regarded one of the best SPACE WARS players ever, even if
he's only number 162 in the main ranking list.

Maybe you can prove to Marc that you have talent at SPACE WARS too!

You are back at Tiny Hamlet.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.
%E
%Cp Spa 00005
"Big day today, %p, huh?"
%E
%Cp Spa 00006
"Think you're ready to step in the footsteps of Marc, our grandmaster?"
%E
%Cp Spa 00007
"Our grandmaster, Marc, is the best SPACE WARS player there ever was."
%E
%Cp Spa 00008
"Have you read the book named 'Marc's Abenteuer'?"
%E
%Cp Spa 00009
"Up to now Marc is the only one to ever defeat Arabella in a real match."
%E
%Cp Spa 00010
"You're indeed a great SPACE WARS player, %p!"
%E
%Cp Spa 00011
"Far out, %p, you managed to beat Arabella!"
%E
%Cp Spa 00012
"How the heck could you best Arabella and her constant use of cheats?"
%E
%Cp Spa 00013
"You defeated Arabella, %p - a deed that I didn't achieve yet!"
%E
%Cp Spa 00014
"Wow %p, you're almost as good at SPACE WARS as Marc, our grandmaster!"
%E
%Cc Spa 00015
"Hi there %p, little fella! So you're a SPACE WARS player, too?
Great! It's nice to meet you. Maybe you can show off your skills.
Indeed, there's this girl named Arabella, and she's damn hard to beat
at this game. Of course, I bested her seven times in a row. But nobody
else has ever managed to defeat her at SPACE WARS.

If you want to impress me, you may try to play against her. But first
I'll check if you're going to stand any chance. Okay?"
%E
%Cp Spa 00016
"Ah, I see you haven't run in fear, %p. Ready to play now?"
%E
%Cp Spa 00017
"You're too fearful, %p. I'd advise you to be ready for Arabella now."
%E
%Cc Spa 00018
"Sorry %p, but you'll have to decide for yourself if you want to try
beating Arabella at SPACE WARS now. There's also other things that I
have to do, so I can't help you any more now."
%E
%Cc Spa 00019
"%p, your character is too low-level in order to stand a chance!
Arabella can probably take off more hit points in a single hit than
your maximum amount, meaning she might one-hit-kill you! If you
absolutely must, you can proceed and try to get to her, but I'd
really advise you to go level-grinding first!"
%E
%Cc Spa 00020
"Okay %p, if you want then you can go on, but you won't get no help
from me unless you improve your alignment score.

For if you don't worship %d, one of SPACE WARS' big and nasty boss
monsters, I unfortunately can't trust you."
%E
%Cc Spa 00021
"%p, you may actually stand a chance against Arabella. Know that she
uses lots of tricks and traps, trying to make your life hard. But
she's also always fair, even if her tactics may seem like cheating.

So here's some advice. You will need to get past the drawbridge in
order to reach the Underground River. Traversing the river will
probably require a method of digging. After that, you're on your own.

But one more thing; Arabella waits for you in the Inside Part. If
you've read the book that my brother wrote about me, named
'Marc's Abenteuer', you will know what that is. By the way, in order
to get the book, just do a Google search for it.

Good luck with your fight against Arabella, and don't get killed!"
%E
%Cp Spa 00025
"Even Arabella has some weaknesses; you should try to exploit them."
%E
%Cp Spa 00026
"My advice for reaching Arabella? Use digging tools."
%E
%Cp Spa 00027
"You may want to be able to teleport."
%E
%Cp Spa 00028
"Statues aren't always what they seem."
%E
%Cp Spa 00029
"You may encounter some of Arabella's friends fighting on her side."
%E
%Cp Spa 00030
"Reaching Arabella will be much easier if you can do controlled polymorphs."
%E
%Cp Spa 00031
"If you're really lucky, an acquaintance of mine named Sizzle might show up to help you."
%E
%Cp Spa 00032
"Each of Arabella's friends has their own unique strengths."
%E
%Cp Spa 00033
"You should be proficient both at melee combat and spellcasting if you want to win."
%E
%Cp Spa 00034
"Now go, %p, I can't wait to see if you can defeat Arabella!"
%E
%Cc Spa 00035
After traversing the Underground River, you reach a place
that somehow reminds you of the Hamlet.

But... why are there so many trees here?

You quickly realize there's got to be something wrong here.
%E
%Cp Spa 00036
Once again, you enter a weird version of the Hamlet that you used to see at the start of your adventures.
%E
%Cc Spa 00040
Finally. You've made it past the terrifying statue halls,
and this place has got to be Inside Part.

From what you (hopefully) know, entering the actual Inside Part
and traversing it can both be quite hard without the right tools.

But you also need to find Arabella somewhere and defeat her. Maybe
she even has a powerful artifact that you might use for yourself?

And of course, Marc warned you that Arabella may have brought
some of her friends. You'll have to be very careful.
%E
%Cp Spa 00041
Once again, you enter Inside Part, ready to defeat Arabella.
%E
%Cc Spa 00050
"Oh! Greetings, %p! Well met. I'm Arabella, and I'm your opponent
for today's match.

May the better one of us win!"
%E
%Cc Spa 00051
"I'm not used to run around in the actual inside part, mind you.
But it's not like I can't do it at all either, you know."
%E
%Cp Spa 00052
"It's been fun dancing with you, %p, but sooner or later, one of us must win."
%E
%Cp Spa 00053
"Oh, you're indeed very tricky, %p! Well done! Let's see if you can keep my artifact!"
%E
%Cp Spa 00060
"Hmm, let's see which spell I want to use next..."
%E
%Cp Spa 00061
"Maybe forcing you to play without using your right mouse button would be a good idea."
%E
%Cp Spa 00062
"I'd like to fill up your inventory with cursed items to stack the deck in my favor."
%E
%Cp Spa 00063
"Come on %p, walk into some of my traps! I've placed them just for you!"
%E
%Cp Spa 00064
"Using my teleport control, I can quickly chase you if you want to run away."
%E
%Cp Spa 00065
"Tell me where your stash is, I'd like to collect all of your wands and use them on you!"
%E
%Cp Spa 00066
"more tsprecher deactivated, correct messages about radio are through-said!"
%E
%Cp Spa 00067
"A lightsaber duel might be fun, don't you think?"
%E
%Cp Spa 00068
"Don't forget to click on the cursed called using your right mouse button."
%E
%Cp Spa 00069
"What are you saying, you're not using Windows 3.1? But that's the best operating system for playing SPACE WARS!"
%E
%Cc Spa 00070
So Arabella's artifact was a Helm of Storms. If you read
your sources correctly, it will give you resistance to all
elements and some other useful benefits.
%E
%Cc Spa 00080
Arabella has been defeated by %p.

With her player character avatar disappearing from your screen,
she speaks:
"Wow. Masterfully played, %p! You're really good at SPACE WARS.

luck on your future quests! May %d be with you, and maybe we'll
meet for a rematch some day!

%Cc Spa 00081
Marc speaks:

"%p... you actually managed to beat Arabella???

Uh... I didn't expect anyone to be capable of defeating her,
apart from me of course, but you have done it. I am impressed.

Of course you can keep the Helm of Storms and the Bell of Opening,
since I have no use for them anyway. After all, I've managed to beat
Arabella and all four of her friends teamed up against me - I tell
you, that was a long, grueling battle! Sure, I had that fellow Sizzle
helping me, but still... oh wait, I guess you don't want to hear about
my old stories.

Yeah; well done, %p. Your victory shows that there's actually new

Really now. Come on, you'll never even reach her, let alone beat her in
a real game. She will probably instakill you on her first move.

"Well, I'll give your character about... let's say three turns, and if
you're still on the same level as Arabella then she'll kill you. Better

equipment...

Anyway, don't sweat it! You're just not good enough at this game yet,

%Cc Cam 00021
"Your character doesn't look too bad to me, if I have to be honest...
Let's see: moderately good hit points, bad AC but you might just try to
kill everything faster than it can kill you, and you also have some
important intrinsics.

Of course there's still lots of holes in your current setup, but it's
probably not going to get any better considering your low playing skill,
so I'd go forth and fight Arabella now if I were you. There's still about
a 98%% chance that you'll die, but who knows...

Arabella has been defeated by %p.

With her player character avatar disappearing from your screen,
she speaks:
"No, it can't be! This is impossible!!!

...

Well, a loss is a loss, and I hereby congratulate you.
But I'd really like to watch the replay of this game to see how you
managed to beat me. I really hope you didn't use cheats, as that would
be against the rules.

Anyway, you may take the silver bell now and go on with your game.
Good luck, and happy ascending!"

Marc speaks:

"%p... you actually managed to beat Arabella???

Uh... I didn't expect anyone to be capable of defeating her,
apart from me of course, but you have done it. I am impressed.
Even more so since I expected you to be a very bad player.

Of course you can keep the Amulet of Kings and the Bell of Opening,
since I have no use for them anyway. After all, I've managed to beat
Arabella and all four of her friends teamed up against me - I tell
you, that was a long, grueling battle! Sure, I had that fellow Sizzle
helping me, but still... oh wait, I guess you don't want to hear about
my old stories.

Yeah; well done, %p. Your victory shows that not all new Camperstrike
players actually suck. I still can't believe that you did it, but I've
been watching your ttyrec while you were playing.
And I gotta admit, even though she gave it her best, zapping you with
her wand repeatedly and casting nasty spell after nasty spell, you
discovered a nifty way of killing her. I never thought that method
would even be able to defeat her at all, since a master player like her
is too good to fall for such a weak tactic, but...

Anyway, see you soon!"

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Cam 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Cam 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

%Cc Cam 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Cam 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Cam 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.

was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Aci 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Aci 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Aci 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

%Cc Aci 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly

The only problem is that %o have once been in our possession, and
they were stolen by a malicious girl named %n. She's pretty,

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly

Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Trs 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

%Cc Trs 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Trs 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Cou 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Cou 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Cou 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Cou 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be

you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Gof 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Gof 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

%Cc Bar 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete

the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral

    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will

you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Blo 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Blo 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Blo 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Blo 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Blo 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

%Cc Blo 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Blo 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such

"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly

of Yendor!

"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
speaks of you.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will

That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.

%Cp Dru 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Dru 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Dru 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

%Cc Dru 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Dru 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Dru 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

%Cc Dru 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Dru 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.

useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.

Suddenly, you stand before the ruins of an ancient building. All 
around you, shadows flit and flicker below an indistinct sky. A
cold breeze blows in aimless breaths, bearing the rumor of distant
whispers.

You know this place well; though you have been here but one before,
and that in a dream. That night, as you stood over the strange, dry
corpse that sprawls alone within the shell of this ruined library,
the wind whispered to you with a thousand tounges, speaking the 
names that still ring in your ears, the names that drove you
into exile.

You do not dream now. The wind is filled with a muted tension, 
as of a scream just bellow the threshold of hearing, and dark
creatures stalk the wastes around %H.

Once again, you stand before %H.  You know that %l

"The world is in great need of your assistance, %p.

"About six months ago, I learned that a mysterious sorcerer, known
as %n, had begun to gather a large group of cutthroats and brigands
about him.

"At about the same time, these people you once rode with `liberated' a
potent magical talisman, %o, from a Turanian caravan.

"%nC and his Black Horde swept down upon %i and defeated
the people there, driving them out into the desert.  He has taken
%o, and seeks to bend it to his will.  I detected the
subtle changes in the currents of fate, and joined these people.
Then I sent forth a summons for you.

"If %n can bend %o to his will, he will become
almost indestructible.  He will then be able to enslave the minds of
men across the world.  You are the only hope.  The gods smile upon you,
and with %d behind you, you alone can defeat %n.

When %l sees %o, he smiles, and says:

    Well done, %p.  You have saved the world from certain doom.
    What, now, should be done with %o?

    These people, brave as they are, cannot hope to guard it from
    other sorcerers who will detect it, as surely as %n did.

    Take %o with you, %p.  It will guard you in

%E
%Cc Bin 00091
"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly
succeed in your quest, but here you are in possession of the Amulet
of Yendor!

"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
speaks of you.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will
    stand by %d as champion of all %cP for eternity.

"This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."
%E
%Cc Bin 00095
"You have betrayed all those who hold allegiance to %d, as you once did.
My allegiance to %d holds fast and I cannot condone or accept what you 
have done.

Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at %H again.
That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.
%E

%Cp Bin 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!
Look for a ...ic transporter.
You couldn't quite make out that last message.
%E
%Cp Bin 00101
You again sense %l pleading for help.
%E
%Cp Bin 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Bin 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Bin 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the

%E
%Cc Bin 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Bin 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Bin 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Bin 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Bin 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Bin 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Bin 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Bin 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Bin 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be

somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Acu 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

%Cc Acu 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

Uh-oh. This place is called %H now?

You remember a time when you, %l and many others were
children, happily playing in the sandbox and going to your wise
doctor for an ointment if anyone of you started bleeding.

It's that damnable curse which you were always afraid of - if any
of you started bleeding, it just wouldn't stop for a long time.
Even minor cuts could prove deadly if you didn't reach your doctor
in time.

But now it seems %l and the other brethren are facing
even worse times. The presence of a hospital might mean some of them
are even close to dying! Certainly this is why %l is
calling for you!

"Shortly after you left on your vision quest, the caves were invaded by

"She, herself, could not attack us due to her great size, but her minions
have harassed us ever since.  In the first attacks, many died, and the

They took it to %i and there, none of our

Once again, you approach %i.

You find yourself in a large cavern, with neatly polished walls, that

You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:

You again sense %l pleading for help.

"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be

%E
%Cc Cav 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Cav 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Cav 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Cav 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Cav 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Cav 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Cav 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Cav 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Cav 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Cav 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Cav 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Cav 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Fla 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Fla 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Cra 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Cra 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Cra 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Cra 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Cra 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Cra 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Sma 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!

After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Sma 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Sma 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Sma 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Sma 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Sma 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Sma 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly

This must be the special place where the entrance to

of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Yau 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Yau 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

%Cc Psy 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%Cc Psy 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!

%Cc Psy 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Psy 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Psy 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Psy 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Psy 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Psy 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Mam 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Mam 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Mam 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Mam 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Mam 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

%Cc Ast 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Ast 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Ast 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Ast 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Ast 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Ast 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Ast 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Dis 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Dis 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

"This is wondrous, %p.  I feared that you could not possibly

of Yendor!

"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
speaks of you.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will
    stand by %d as champion of all %cP for eternity.

"This is all I know, %p.  I hope it will help you."
%E
%Cc Fir 00095
"You have betrayed all those who hold allegiance to %d, as you once did.
My allegiance to %d holds fast and I cannot condone or accept what you 
have done.

Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at %H again.
That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.
%E

%Cp Fir 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!
Look for a ...ic transporter.
You couldn't quite make out that last message.

%Cp Fir 00101
You again sense %l pleading for help.

%Cp Fir 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Fir 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Fir 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Fir 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Fir 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Fir 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Fir 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Fir 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Fir 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Fir 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Con 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Con 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Con 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Act 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Act 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Act 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Act 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Act 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Hea 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Hea 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book
speaks of you.

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral
    Plane, where the Great Temple of %d is to be found.  The Amulet
    will be sacrificed to %d, there on His altar.  Then the child will

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Jed 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.

on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Jed 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Jed 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Jed 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Jed 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Jed 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Jed 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Jed 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Jed 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Kni 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Kni 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Kni 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Kni 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Kni 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Kni 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

%Cc Trc 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

%Cc Trc 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles

%Cc Stu 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Stu 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Stu 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Stu 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Stu 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Stu 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Stu 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Stu 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Roc 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

%Cc Roc 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Roc 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

%Cc Roc 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

%E
%Cc War 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc War 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc War 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc War 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc War 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc War 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful

you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become

It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

%E
%Cc Che 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Che 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

%Cc Che 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Che 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Che 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles

guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Mon 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Mon 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Mon 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

%Cc Mon 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.
%E

%Cp Sai 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!
Look for a ...ic transporter.
You couldn't quite make out that last message.
%E
%Cp Sai 00101
You again sense %l pleading for help.
%E
%Cp Sai 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Sai 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Sai 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos subdungeons.

%E
%Cc Sai 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Sai 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Sai 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Sai 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Sai 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Sai 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Sai 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Sai 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Sai 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Sai 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Sai 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

%Cc Psi 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

%Cc Med 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%Cc Med 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!

%Cc Med 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Med 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Med 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Med 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Med 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Med 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Ordered Chaos.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Forging Chamber and Dead Grounds subdungeons.
%E
%Cc Nob 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%Cc Nob 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Nob 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Nob 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Nob 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Nob 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Nob 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Nob 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Nob 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

%Cc Nob 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Nob 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

Finally, you got what you kame for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases kan be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Khamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Khaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly

Not to forget karving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, kulminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Kongraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the kreator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
konsidering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and khills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so klose to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
konsecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Kandle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you kan komplete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell kan be found; specifically, the
Bell Kaves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven kandles
to the kandelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.

Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Nec 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

This book seems important somehow, but you're way too exhausted to
actually bother reading it.
%E
%Cc Fai 00113
"Oh my god", you exclaim spontaneously as you pick up the amulet.

It's really true! The Amulet of Yendor actually exists! You know
that it can help you on your path to a better existence, but how
are you going to use it?

Then you remember something about altars. But something about
the amulet seems to be wrong. If only you knew what that is...
%E
%Cc Fai 00114
You can hear the taunts of the feared %l as you offer
the Amulet of Yendor to %d.

But this time, everything is different. All the insults that he's
trying to throw at you seem to not affect you at all, and instead,
you finally feel like an accomplished person.

Suddenly, the voice of %d announces:
"Mortal, thou hast overcome thy fate!!! Let it be known that thou
shalt no longer be referred to as a 'Failed Existence' now.
Thy title will henceforth be 'Demigod'!!!"

You can hear %l scream in agony, and a moment later, you
find yourself in front of his grave and spontaneously start to dance.

And you lived happily ever after... :-)

The End!
%E
%Cc Fai 00115
You can hear the taunts of the feared %l as you offer
the Amulet of Yendor to %d.

While waiting for your deity to grant you immortality,
you remember what he had said...

"Ah well, I hope you try to ascend on the wrong altar and die. Begone!",
those have been the last words you heard from him.

Suddenly, you realize that the old bastard won! You immediately
start hating yourself more than ever before and just wish you were dead.
In your monumental stupidity, you actually offered the amulet on the
wrong altar and now your remaining life will be an endless misery!
A moment later, you see %l rummaging through your possessions,
throwing your valuables into the trash can, or worse, incinerating them.
You just want to put your head into a pillow and weep for all eternity...

The End!
%E
%Cc Fai 00116
You suddenly realize that you have to bring certain tools to this place.

But this is so much work! Is it really worth it? It'll take forever to
get them all here, and for what? %l always told you that
anything you attempt will result in failure anyway...
%E
%Cc Fai 00117
Picking up this stone causes you to relive the worst moment in your life,
the one where %l threw you out, but not until he had taken and destroyed
your most precious pair of shoes.
But then the stone also subjects you to a vision of you knocking the
everloving shit out of that bastard and tainting his grave after
killing him.
You're not sure if you want to carry around a stone that produces such
visions...

Oh damn it all! You can't seem to drop it because of course the stone
is cursed! Why can't you ever have some good luck for a change? :(

"Yes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall
tell you of what has transpired:

"At one of the Great Festivals a short time ago, %n and a legion
of undead invaded %H.  Many %gP were killed, including
the one carrying %o.

"As a final act of vengefulness, %n desecrated the altar here.
Without it, we could not mount a counter-attack.  Now, there are
barely enough %gP left to keep the undead at bay.

"We need you to find %i, then, from there, travel
to %ns lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n and return
%o here, we can then drive off the legions of
undead that befoul the land.

"Go with %d as your guide, %p."

%Cp Pri 00025
"You can prevail, if you rely on %d."

"Remember that %n has great magic at his command."

"Be pure, my %S."
%E
%Cp Pri 00028
"Beware, %i is surrounded by a great graveyard."
%E
%Cp Pri 00029
"You may be able to affect %n with magical cold."
%E
%Cp Pri 00030
"Acquire and wear %o if you can.  It will aid you
against %n."
%E
%Cp Pri 00031
"Call upon %d when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
%E
%Cp Pri 00032
"The undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours."
%E
%Cp Pri 00033
"Do not lose faith, %p.  If you do so, %n will grow stronger."

"Wear %o.  It will assist you against the undead."
%E
%Cc Pri 00035
You stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
that seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
undead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.

You remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by
%lC.  It is ahead that you will find %ns trail.
%E
%Cp Pri 00036
Again, you stand before %i.
%E
%Cc Pri 00040
The stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans

Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...

Again, you have invaded %ns domain.
%E
%Cc Pri 00050
"Ah, so %lC has sent another %g to retrieve

"Submit to my will, %c, and I shall spare you."

As you pick up %o, you feel the essence of

%Cc Pri 00080
You feel a wrenching shift in the ether as %ns body dissolves

Suddenly, a voice booms out:

    Thou hast defeated the least of my minions, %r.
    Know now that Moloch is aware of thy presence.
    As for thee, %n, I shall deal with thy failure

You then hear the voice of %n, screaming in terror...

%Cc Pri 00081
"You have returned, %p.  And with %o, I see.
Congratulations.

"I have been in meditation, and have received direction from

of Yendor.

"Go forth, and let %d guide your steps."
%E

"Welcome back, %p.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"

%Cc Pri 00091
"You have prevailed, %p!  %d is surely with you.  Now,

%E
%Cc Pri 00095
"You have betrayed all those who hold allegiance to %d, as you once did.
My allegiance to %d holds fast and I cannot condone or accept what you

Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at %H again.
That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.
%E

%Cp Pri 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!
Look for a ...ic transporter.
You couldn't quite make out that last message.
%E
%Cp Pri 00101
You again sense %l pleading for help.
%E
%Cp Pri 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Pri 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Pri 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos subdungeons.

%E
%Cc Pri 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Pri 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Pri 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Pri 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Pri 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Pri 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Pri 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,

Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Ran 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Ran 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Ran 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Ran 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Ran 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Ran 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Ran 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Ran 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

%Cc Ran 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be

you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Mas 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

%Cc Mas 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of

you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.
%E
%Cp Elp 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!

%Cp Elp 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Elp 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Elp 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos subdungeons.

%Cc Elp 00105

The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Ordered Chaos.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Forging Chamber and Dead Grounds subdungeons.
%E
%Cc Elp 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Elp 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Elp 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Elp 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Elp 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Elp 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Elp 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Elp 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Elp 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Elp 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Elp 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Twe 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Twe 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Twe 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Twe 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Twe 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Twe 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Twe 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Twe 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Twe 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

"A short time ago, the Uruk-hai tribes of the mountains to the east
invaded and enslaved the goblin tribes in this area.  The local
%nt is now only a figurehead, and serves the Uruk-hai Overlord.

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of
orcs and goblins, as you witnessed.  In the first onslaught a group,
headed by %n himself, managed to breach the circle and
steal %o.

"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.

"If we are to survive, you, %p, must infiltrate
%i.  There, you will find a pathway down, to the
underground castle of %n.  He has always coveted
%o, and will surely keep it on his person,

%Cc Sli 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Sli 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.

After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',

on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Sli 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Sli 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Sli 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Sli 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Sli 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Sli 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

%Cc Sli 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Sli 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Alt 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

"A short time ago, the Uruk-hai tribes of the mountains to the east
invaded and enslaved the goblin tribes in this area.  The local
%nt is now only a figurehead, and serves the Uruk-hai Overlord.

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of

headed by %n himself, managed to breach the circle and
steal %o.

"Since then, we have been besieged.  We do not know how much longer
we will be able to maintain our magical barriers.

Now attend to me, %p, and I will tell you what must be done:

"The Amulet has within it magic, the capability to transport you to
the Astral Plane, where the primary circle of %d resides.

When you reach the temple, sacrifice the Amulet to %d.

Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at %H again.
That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.

%Cp Bos 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:

%Cp Bos 00101
You again sense %l pleading for help.
%E
%Cp Bos 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Bos 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Bos 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the

%Cc Bos 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Bos 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Bos 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Bos 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Bos 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Bos 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Bos 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Bos 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Dun 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Dun 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Dun 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.

"During our last gathering of worship here, we were beset by hordes of

"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be

%E

%Cc Tha 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Tha 00104

%Cc Tha 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Tha 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Tha 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Tha 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Tha 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Tha 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Tha 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Tha 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Tha 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Tha 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Tha 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Mus 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Mus 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Mus 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Mus 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Mus 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Mus 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Mus 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Mus 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Mus 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Mus 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

You now enter what is pretty known to you - it is the location of

the computer game "NetHack". 

With a sudden feeling of melancholy you remember the patches you

"Now I see you with the Amulet Of Yendor shining brightly in your

Your way is up now, back to the first level of the Dungeon, and
beyond there. You now must leave the dungeon as you've entered
it.

Then you will get to four planes, dedicated to the four arcane elements
of earth, air, fire and water. If thou successfully pass all these,
you will eventually reach the stars (or astra, as the Greek called
them). This is where the sacred High Temples of the aligned gods
are located. 

Return the amulet to %d at His altar, and you will be richly rewarded."

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where

"Now I see you with the Amulet Of Yendor shining brightly in your
pack. Honestly, I didn't believe you'd (or anyone else, for that
matter) would manage to tear it from the hands of Moloch.

Your way is up now, back to the first level of the Dungeon, and
beyond there. You now must leave the dungeon as you've entered
it.

Then you will get to four planes, dedicated to the four arcane elements
of earth, air, fire and water. If thou successfully pass all these,
you will eventually reach the stars (or astra, as the Greek called
them). This is where the sacred High Temples of the aligned gods
are located. 

Return the amulet to %d at His altar, and you will be richly rewarded."

"You have betrayed all those who hold allegiance to %d, as you once did.

you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,

%E
%Cc Gra 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Gra 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Gra 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Gra 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

%Cc Gra 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Gra 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

%Cc Rog 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Dem 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Dem 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the

%E
%Cc Dem 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Dem 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Dem 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Dem 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Dem 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Dem 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Dem 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Dem 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Dem 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds

Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles

The world rights itself in front of you as you realize you have arrived

You attempt to go towards the building, but a man walks by you as you 
begin your trek. You notice he attempts to reach into your pocket and take 
something from you, but you quickly and quietly subdue him. After scouting 
out the area, you notice there is a lot of thievery going on throughout 
the small town that houses the League of Assassins. Something has gone

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Fox 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Fox 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Fox 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Fox 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Fox 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

%Cc Fox 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Loc 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.

%Cc Loc 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Loc 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Loc 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Loc 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Loc 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Loc 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Loc 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

%E
%Cc Gre 00080
Your healing skills tell you that %ns wounds are mortal.

You know that the bushido tells you to finish him and let his kami

You order that his unwashed head be given to the crows and his body
thrown into the sea.
%E
%Cc Gre 00081
As you bow before %l, he welcomes you:

    You have brought your family great honor, %p-sama.

    While you have been gone the emperor's advisors have discovered in
    the ancient texts that the karma of the samurai who seeks to recover
    the amulet and the karma of %o are joined
    as the seasons join to make a year.

    Because you have shown such fidelity, the emperor requests
    that you take leave of other obligations and continue on the
    road that fate has set your feet upon.  I would consider it
    an honor if you would allow me to watch your household until
    you return with the amulet.

With that, %l bows, and places his sword atop
%o.
%E
%Cc Gre 00082
%l holds %o tightly for a moment, then returns
his gaze to you.

"The time is ripe to recover the Amulet.  Return to %Z
through the magic portal that transported you here so that you may
achieve the destiny which awaits you."
%E
%Cp Gre 00090
%lC bows.  "%p-sama, tell us of your search for the Amulet."
%E
%Cc Gre 00091
"Ah, %p-sama.  You have wasted your efforts returning home.
Now that you are in possession of the Amulet, you are honor-bound to
finish the quest you have undertaken.  There will be plenty of time
for saki and stories when you have finished.

"Go now, and may our prayers be a wind at your back."
%E
%Cc Gre 00095
"You have betrayed all those who hold allegiance to %d, as you once did.
My allegiance to %d holds fast and I cannot condone or accept what you

Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at %H again.
That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.
%E
%Cp Gre 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!

You again sense %l pleading for help.

%Cp Gre 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Gre 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Gre 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos subdungeons.

%E
%Cc Gre 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Gre 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Gre 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Gre 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Gre 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Gre 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Gre 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Gre 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Gre 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Gre 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Gre 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly

If this thing can whip a woman, it can certainly whip a man too, right?

%n screams in agony as he realizes you landed the final blow on him.

But, he's not dead yet. He is slowly bleeding out from his mortal wound,
and you take the opportunity to stomp his balls repeatedly with your heels.
As you keep causing pain to %n, his screams are echoing from the halls,
but only when you finally manage to lacerate his scrotum veins for good,
you finally let go of him.

It still takes what feels like hours until %n's wounds finally kill him,

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

%Cc Fem 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%Cc Fem 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!

%Cc Fem 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Fem 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Fem 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Fem 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Fem 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Fem 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!

%Cc Dol 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Dol 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Dol 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Dol 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Dol 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Dol 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Dol 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Dol 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Sla 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

%Cc Sla 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Tou 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

%E
%Cc Wil 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Wil 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

%Cc Wil 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Wil 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you

You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual

the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be

somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Art 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Art 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Art 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.

and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be

somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Sex 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Sex 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Bul 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Bul 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Bul 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Bul 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

%Cc Car 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly

Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete

This must be the special side challenge that you have to undertake!
Here at %H, certain types of fishes live that will put your
abilities to the test, in particular your ability to resist
their sexy charms.

Apparently %l is here to guide you too...
%E
%Cp Fjo 00002
Once again, you are back at %H.
%E
%Cp Fjo 00003
You are back at %H.
You have an odd feeling this may be the last time you ever come here.

%Cp Fjo 00005
"Did you see that beautiful red fish?"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00006
"That last fish I saw had huuuuuge teeth!"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00007
"Do you agree that carnivorous fish are the sexiest of all?"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00008
"I'd like to go for another swim..."

%Cp Fjo 00009
"%l has an important message for you."

"Once I saw a fish with rainbow colors!"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00011
"Fishes are soooo sexy <3"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00012
"You should take another swim."

"You're on a good pace I think!"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00014
"You really like deep water, right?"
%E
%Cc Fjo 00015
"Welcome %p! There's a special challenge waiting for you, but
I can't allow you to proceed unless you're ready. Let me test you."
%E
%Cp Fjo 00016
"%p, you still need to go on your special challenge!
I'll again test whether you are ready."
%E
%Cp Fjo 00017
"%p, you're falling behind! You should hope that you're
ready for the special challenge now."
%E
%Cc Fjo 00018
"Damn %p, you waited too long. Now your opportunity
to claim the first place has passed.
I can't help you anymore now."
%E
%Cc Fjo 00019
"Well you're being seduced even by the small fishes!
How are you supposed to be able to be able to stand against
the really big one that's waiting for you?"
%E
%Cc Fjo 00020
"You're too crazy about fishes right now! Think of
something else for a while before you come back and try again!"
%E
%Cc Fjo 00021
"%p, so your task is to meet %n.
Be victorious and you'll get %o as a reward, too!
You will find that huge fish at %i."
%E
%Cp Fjo 00025
"Go ahead and have sex with %n!"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00026
"Of course we've placed lots of other fishes on the path to %i for you."
%E
%Cp Fjo 00027
"You will always remember %n!"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00028
"If you can claim %o, water will be even more fun for you."
%E
%Cp Fjo 00029
"Better hurry, your lead is small and you might lose your first place."
%E
%Cp Fjo 00030
"Use your swimming abilities."
%E
%Cp Fjo 00031
"Being bitten by %n will be really arousing for your penis."
%E
%Cp Fjo 00032
"Think of it this way, you're going to have a lot of fun!"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00033
"If you don't come out on top of your meeting with %n, you can't continue!"
%E
%Cp Fjo 00034
"Do you need help? I'm officially not allowed to give you too much help!"
%E
%Cc Fjo 00035
You feel that you're getting closer to %i.
%E
%Cp Fjo 00036
You still feel that %i must be nearby.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00040
This is %i, %n's lair!
Now you need to prepare for a sexual encounter,
and if you're lucky, you can then claim %o!
%E
%Cp Fjo 00041
You remember that you need to encounter %n and claim %o!
%E
%Cc Fjo 00050
Wow... so this is %n. You're in awe.
This fish is sooooooo big! Hopefully you'll get to have some fun now!
%E
%Cc Fjo 00051
You really look forward to seeing what %n can do to you.
%E
%Cp Fjo 00052
You no longer care about how long you need. %n is here,
and you're having the most fun of your life!
%E
%Cp Fjo 00053
With %o in your possession, dancing with %n becomes
even more pleasant!
%E
%Cp Fjo 00060
Wow, you wonder how much more fun it will be to reencounter %n in nightmare difficulty.
%E
%Cp Fjo 00061
If %n is so hot even in normal difficulty, you can't wait to see what it would be like in hell mode!
%E
%Cp Fjo 00062
You want to have fun with %n's sharp teeth!
%E
%Cp Fjo 00063
Maybe being eaten whole by %n would feel arousing?
%E
%Cp Fjo 00064
You're about to have a sexual orgasm.
%E
%Cp Fjo 00065
Wait, this is only an intermediate challenge? But there
can't possibly exist an even bigger fish somewhere else?!
%E
%Cp Fjo 00066
Suddenly you notice that your hand has wandered to your penis
and you inadvertently started wanking off to the sight of %n.
%E
%Cp Fjo 00067
You feel that you want to marry %n!
%E
%Cp Fjo 00068
Sexual arousal. This is it. Smaller fishes have managed to
tickle your fancy, but %n beats all of them.
%E
%Cp Fjo 00069
You're sooooo excited right now.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00070
The scuba gear allows you to be underwater for longer!
This is great - a chance to get really close to your beloved fishes!
%E
%Cp Fjo 00080
Awwwwwwwwww, you defeated %n. That's unfortunate.
Now the fun is over. But then again, you have a race to win, and
you might still be in first place right now;
better hurry back to %l!
%E
%Cc Fjo 00081
%l exclaims:
"You got %o! That's great, now you can swim the deep waters
and reach places you couldn't get to before!"
%E
%Cc Fjo 00082
"Why are you giving the scuba gear to me, you need it much more
than I do. Here, you can have it back. Wear it!"
%E
%Cc Fjo 00090
"Well done %p, but now you should hurry, lest you lose
your beautiful lead and won't finish first!"
%E
%Cc Fjo 00091
"This is the final stretch, %p! There's still a bunch of fishes
on the path ahead, but you're almost at your goal!
Get going and win the race, then you'll get the reward of your life!"
%E
%Cc Fjo 00095
"It seems that you tried to use cheats, which is forbidden.
You are hereby banned. No matter how fast you are, there will not
be a reward for you if you 'win'. Be ashamed of yourself!"
%E

%Cp Fjo 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
There is a special challenge that you must take at %H!
Look for a ...ic transporter.
You couldn't quite make out that last message.
%E
%Cp Fjo 00101
You again sense %l announcing a challenge.
%E
%Cp Fjo 00102
"I know that you're not really in need of it, but %n has
a silver bell, without which you won't be able to reach the goal.
Go get that bell."
%E

%Cc Fjo 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos subdungeons.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00105
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Dead Grounds.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the

%E
%Cc Fjo 00106
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Ordered Chaos.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Forging Chamber and Dead Grounds subdungeons.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Fjo 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Fjo 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Fjo 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And that's not all there is! %l appears before you, and
announces what your reward is: since you actually won the race,
you now have many days, maybe even months, during which you can
revisit all the areas and have fun with fishes endlessly.
You've earned this reward. Even that crazy shoe fetishist
(apparently it's the real identity of AmyBSOD) was slower than
you, coming in at second place, because you're simply the best.
All hail to %p the Fjorde!

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Fjo 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Fjo 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Fjo 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't

The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom

Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...

You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!

You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.

"I have studied the texts of the magi constantly since you left.  In
the Book of Skelos, I found this:

    %d will cause a child to be sent into the world.  This child is to
    be made strong by trial of battle and magic, for %d has willed it so.
    It is said that the child of %d will recover the Amulet of Yendor
    that was stolen from the Creator at the beginning of time.

"As you now possess the amulet, %p, I suspect that the Book

    The child of %d will take the Amulet, and travel to the Astral

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly

Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,

Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Mil 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Mil 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Mil 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Mil 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Mil 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Mil 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Sym 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Sym 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Sym 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Sym 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.

you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Com 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Com 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete

a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!

%E
%Cc Sco 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Sco 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Sco 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Sco 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Sco 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Sco 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Sco 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Sco 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

%d has devised a plan to weaken Hans Walt, but before you can undertake

Seek a doctor and become sane again and then come back!"
%E
%Cc Hus 00021
"The task that %d wants you to perform is simple, yet dangerous.

As you may well know, us Hussies are in a perpetual fight against the
authorities of this school. Hans Walt is rallying all the teachers,
and as a result, we don't get to have any fun.

But we're girls! And girls wanna have fun! Therefore, we must stop
the oppression and show the teachers that we can do whatever we want.
Great Corner-Hard and that left-wing radical Guenter are the main
perpetrators, they go so far and even ban chewing gum from the
classrooms! This is intolerable!

So I'm assigning the task of getting rid of Great Corner-Hard to you.
At the same time, your fellow hussies Arabella and Anastasia are
looking for Guenter. They'll hopefully be successful in removing him
as well. If we can take them both out, the remaining teachers will
lose a lot of power because they can't be backed up by those two
prime assholes anymore.

You will now travel to %d, defeat all the guards on your path, and
put Great Corner-Hard out of business for good. Now get moving!"

You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.

and Gehennom again.

This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be

somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor

artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Gam 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Gam 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.

You find yourself standing in sight of %H.  Something
is obviously wrong here.  The holy light that usually fills the sky
is gone, and strange human shapes shamble around outside.

You realize that %l needs your assistance!
%E
%Cp Wan 00002
Once again, you stand before %H.
%E
%Cp Wan 00003
Again you face %H.  Your intuition hints that this may be
the final time you come here.
%E
%Cp Wan 00005
"Greetings, %r.  It is good to see you."
%E
%Cp Wan 00006
"Ah, %p!  Surely you can help us in our hour of need."

%Cp Wan 00007
"Greetings, %s.  %lC has great need of your help."

"Have you heard the rumors about the vampire known as 'The Day Walker'
that stalks his own breed?"
%E
%Cp Wan 00013
"With %n destroyed, we are safe once more!"
%E
%Cp Wan 00014
"I hear you are to be nominated as next leader of the order!"
%E
%Cc Wan 00015
"Ah, %p, my %S.  You have returned to us at last.
A great blow has befallen our order; perhaps you can help us.
First, however, I must determine if you are prepared for this
great challenge."
%E
%Cp Wan 00016
"Again, my %S, you stand before me.  Are you ready now to help us?"
%E
%Cp Wan 00017
"Once more, %p, you stand within the sanctum.  Are you ready now?"
%E
%Cc Wan 00018
"You are a heretic, %p!  How can you, %ra, deviate so from the
teachings of %d?  Begone from this temple.  You are no longer
%sa to this order.  We will pray to %d for other assistance,
as you have failed us utterly."
%E
%Cc Wan 00019
"Alas, %p, it is not yet to be.  A mere %r could never
withstand the might of %n.  Go forth, again into the world, and return
when you have attained the post of %R."
%E
%Cc Wan 00020
"This is terrible, %p.  You have deviated from the true path!
You know that %d requires the most strident devotion of this
order.  The %shood must stand for utmost piety.

"Go from here, atone for your sins against %d.  Return only when
you have purified yourself."
%E
%Cc Wan 00021
"Yes, %p.  You are truly ready now.  Attend to me and I shall
tell you of what has transpired:

"Recently, %n and a legion of undead invaded %H.
Many %gP were killed, and %o was stolen from us!

"Now, there are barely enough %gP left to keep
the undead at bay.

"We need you to find %i, and then, from there, travel
to %ns lair.  If you can manage to defeat %n
and return %o here, we can then drive off the
legions of undead that befoul the land.

"Go with %d as your guide, %p."
%E
%Cp Wan 00025
"You can prevail, if you rely on %d."
%E
%Cp Wan 00026
"Remember that %n has great magic at his command."
%E
%Cp Wan 00027
"Be pure, my %S."
%E
%Cp Wan 00028
"Beware, %i is surrounded by a great graveyard."
%E
%Cp Wan 00029
"Remember, no mercy for the evil!"
%E
%Cp Wan 00030
"Acquire and wield %o if you can.  It will aid you
against %n."
%E
%Cp Wan 00031
"Call upon %d when your need is greatest.  You will be answered."
%E
%Cp Wan 00032
"The undead legions are weakest during the daylight hours."
%E
%Cp Wan 00033
"Do not lose faith, %p.  If you do so, %n will grow stronger."
%E
%Cp Wan 00034
"Wear %o.  It will assist you against the undead."
%E
%Cc Wan 00035
You stand facing a large graveyard.  The sky above is filled with clouds
that seem to get thicker closer to the center.  You sense the presence of
undead in larger numbers than you have ever encountered before.

You remember the descriptions of %i, given to you by
%l.  It is ahead that you will find %ns trail.
%E
%Cp Wan 00036
Again, you stand before %i.
%E
%Cc Wan 00040
The stench of brimstone is all about you, and the shrieks and moans
of tortured souls assault your psyche.

Ahead, there is a small clearing amidst the bubbling pits of lava...
%E
%Cp Wan 00041
Again, you have invaded %ns domain.
%E
%Cc Wan 00050
"Ah, so %l has sent another %g to retrieve
%o.

"No, I see you are no %g.  Perhaps I shall have some fun today
after all.  Prepare to die, %r!  You shall never regain
%o."
%E
%Cp Wan 00051
"So, %r.  Again you challenge me."
%E
%Cp Wan 00052
"Die now, %r.  %d has no power here to aid you."
%E
%Cp Wan 00053
"You shall die, %r, and I will have %o back."
%E
%Cp Wan 00060
"Submit to my will, %c, and I shall spare you."
%E
%Cp Wan 00061
"Your puny powers are no match for me, %c."
%E
%Cp Wan 00062
"I shall have you turned into a zombie for my pleasure!"
%E
%Cp Wan 00063
"Despair now, %r.  %d cannot help you."
%E
%Cp Wan 00064
"I shall feast upon your soul for many days, %c."
%E
%Cp Wan 00065
"Your death will be slow and painful.  That I promise!"
%E
%Cp Wan 00066
"You cannot defeat %n, you fool.  I shall kill you now."
%E
%Cp Wan 00067
"Your precious %l will be my next victim."
%E
%Cp Wan 00068
"I feel your powers failing you, %r.  You shall die now."
%E
%Cp Wan 00069
"With %o, nothing can stand in my way."
%E
%Cc Wan 00070
As you pick up %o, you feel the essence of
%d fill your soul.  You know now why %n stole it from
%H, for with it, %ca of %d could
easily defeat his plans.

You sense a message from %d.  Though not verbal, you
get the impression that you must return to %l as soon
as possible.
%E
%Cc Wan 00080
You feel a wrenching shift in the ether as %ns body dissolves
into a cloud of noxious gas.

Suddenly, a voice booms out:

    Mark my words, niggling! I shall return!

You then hear the voice of %n, laughing insanely...
%E
%Cc Wan 00081
"You have returned, %p.  And with %o, I see.
Congratulations.

"I have been in meditation, and have received direction from
a minion of %d.  %d commands that you retain
%o.  With it, you must recover the Amulet
of Yendor.

"Go forth, and let %d guide your steps."
%E
%Cc Wan 00082
%l reiterates that %o is yours now.

"The time has come to resume your search for the Amulet.
%Z await your return through the magic portal which brought
you here."
%E
%Cp Wan 00090
"Welcome back, %p.  How is your quest for the Amulet going?"
%E
%Cc Wan 00091
"You have prevailed, %p!  %d is surely with you.  Now,
you must take the amulet, and sacrifice it on %ds altar on
the Astral plane.  I suspect that I shall never see you again in this
life, but I hope to at %ds feet."
%E
%Cc Wan 00095
"You have betrayed all those who hold allegiance to %d, as you once did.
My allegiance to %d holds fast and I cannot condone or accept what you 
have done.

Leave this place.  You shall never set foot at %H again.
That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.
%E
%Cp Wan 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:
Your help is urgently needed at %H!
Look for a ...ic transporter.
You couldn't quite make out that last message.
%E
%Cp Wan 00101
You again sense %l pleading for help.
%E
%Cp Wan 00102
"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Wan 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Wan 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos subdungeons.
%E
%Cc Wan 00105
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Dead Grounds.

%E
%Cc Wan 00106
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Ordered Chaos.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Forging Chamber and Dead Grounds subdungeons.
%E
%Cc Wan 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Wan 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Wan 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Wan 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Wan 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Wan 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Wan 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Wan 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Wan 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.
%E
%Cc Wan 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Wan 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Unt 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.

%Cc Unt 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Unt 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Unt 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Unt 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Unt 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Unt 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Unt 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

%E
%Cc Jes 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Jes 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Jes 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Jes 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Jes 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

%Cc Jes 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Jes 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

However, things are not the same as when you were last here.  Mists and

"Go now, and take the Amulet to the astral plane.  Once there, present
the Amulet on the altar of %d.  Along the way you shall pass through the

you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.

You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:

"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Wiz 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Wiz 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

In order to be fully imbued, the Amulet must also be taken to the
Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos subdungeons.

%E
%Cc Wiz 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Wiz 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Wiz 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Wiz 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Wiz 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Wiz 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Wiz 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Wiz 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Wiz 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.

    Take %o with you in your quest for

"Congratulations, %p.  I always knew that if anyone could succeed
in defeating the Wizard of Yendor and his minions, it would be you.

"Go now, and take the Amulet to the astral plane.  Once there, present
the Amulet on the altar of %d.  Along the way you shall pass through the

That which you seek is now lost forever, for without the Bell of Opening, 
you will never be able to enter the place where he who has the Amulet 
resides.

Go now!  You are banished from this place.

%Cp Rin 00100
You receive a faint telepathic message from %l:

"The silver bell which was hoarded by %n will be
essential in locating the Amulet of Yendor."
%E
%Cc Rin 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E
%Cc Rin 00104
The Amulet of Yendor radiates brightly as you enter the Forging Chamber.

%Cc Rin 00107
At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Rin 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!
It must hold a good charm, and you decide to hold onto it.
%E
%Cc Rin 00109
After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',
you think, as you pick up this valuable item. It might come in handy
on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Rin 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Rin 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Rin 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Rin 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Rin 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Rin 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

%Cc Rin 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Rin 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc For 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc For 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc For 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc For 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc For 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc For 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...

This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!

After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',

As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden

%E
%Cc Mid 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Mid 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Mid 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Mid 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Mid 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be

and Gehennom again.

%E
%Cc Pol 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Pol 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission

need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

%Cc Pol 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Pol 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Pol 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Pol 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.

%Cc Aug 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Aug 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)

%Cc Aug 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...

This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be

%Cc Sag 00103
As you enter the Bell Caves, the silver bell radiates brightly!
You immediately know that you've successfully imbued it; after all, this
is the place where the bell has originally been forged, and it regained
its original power by being close to its source.

In order to open the path to Moloch's Sanctum, you need two more artifacts.
They're both said to be hidden in Gehennom, in the possession of powerful
guardians. Only with them in your possession can you perform the ritual
on the deepest level of Gehennom and gain access to the place where
the Amulet of Yendor is kept.
%E

At last, you have fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor! You know that now
you have to get to the surface, where your final test awaits.

A strange sensation seems to pull you downwards. This must surely be
the power of the Amulet, and you get ready to traverse Moloch's Sanctum
and Gehennom again.

You also notice the Wizard of Yendor taunting you in your mind.
He must surely have noticed that the Amulet has gained full power now,
and will try his best to stop you on your ascension run...
%E
%Cc Sag 00108
This seemingly mundane gray stone makes you feel lucky as you pick it up!

After a long period of pushing boulders around, you've found a prize.
'Well, at least there is some reward for the hell that is slexoban',

on the path that lies ahead.
%E
%Cc Sag 00110
As the dreadful Medusa finally stops living, you feel an immense burden
lifted from your chest. You now know that you're a capable adventurer,
one who can defeat creatures from legend and live to tell the tale.

Hopefully, you are now ready to face the greater tasks that lie ahead.
%E
%Cc Sag 00111
This menora surely seems important. It must be one of the artifacts
required for the ominous invocation ritual!

You must get two more of these artifacts. One of them is said to be
in the possession of the Wizard of Yendor himself, who is lurking
somewhere in Gehennom; the other such artifact can be obtained if
you engage your personal nemesis in a duel and win...
%E
%Cc Sag 00112
Quickly, you snatch the papyrus spellbook that the Wizard of Yendor
was holding. It is obviously one of the key pieces in your mission
to open the sanctum at the deepest level of Gehennom, but you also
need the silver bell from your quest nemesis, and one more such
artifact is hidden somewhere in Gehennom.
%E
%Cc Sag 00113
Finally, you got what you came for! It's the Amulet of Yendor!!!

Instinctively, you get ready to make a mad dash back to the upstair,
for you know that %d desires this amulet. But something is amiss.

Apparently, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued first, or it won't
let you leave the mortal plane. And in order to imbue the Amulet,
you must search Moloch's sanctum for a hidden magic portal that
will lead you to the Yendorian Tower.

Within the Yendorian Tower, three special staircases are hidden.
You must seek everywhere within the Tower, and enter all three such
staircases in order to imbue the Amulet. This is no easy task.
The Yendorian Tower is about as big as the entire Dungeons of Doom
and Gehennom added together, and the staircases can be anywhere.

Also, it is rumored that if the guardians of the three Alignment Keys
are still alive when you enter the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds
and Ordered Chaos areas, they will grow even stronger to haunt you!
%E
%Cc Sag 00114
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar to %d at last,
you immediately feel an intense surge of power.

You have faced many hardships, survived encounters with deadly
beasts, and even battled the Wizard of Yendor himself and won.
Not to forget carving a path through the Elemental Planes, slaying
their denizens left and right, culminating in the Astral Plane,
where you mowed down all the heretical angels and priests trying
to prevent you from delivering the Amulet to %d.

But now, the entire world around you seems to stop for a moment.
You truly are a demigod now. %d is smiling on you, and leads you
to a place known as the Demigod Bar: Here, the other successful
adventurers are gathered, and they're happily drinking and telling
their stories...

And you get to join them!!! You did it, you've officially become
a true master at your trade, and saved the world from Moloch's
evil schemes! Immediately, you rush to greet your new friends
to tell them about your heroic deeds.

Congraturation! A winner is you! You've beaten SLASH'EM Extended,
one of the most difficult and unfair roguelikes in existence!
Make sure to tell Amy (the creator of the game) about it, too! :-)
%E
%Cc Sag 00115
As you offer the Amulet of Yendor on the high altar,
you somehow don't feel any different at first.

But it has to be true! You just offered the Amulet to %d,
and should be made a demigod any minute now...

Death, Pestilence and Famine still look as threatening as ever.
Something must be very wrong here. Shouldn't you be safe now,
considering you went through Hell and back to get the Amulet
of Yendor for your deity?

Death reaches out with its deadly touch.
You feel your life draining away...
Pestilence reaches out, and you feel fever and chills.
You feel deathly sick.
Famine reaches out, and your body shrivels.
You faint from lack of food.

On the verge of death, you listen to a voice...
'Foolish mortal, thou art an imbecile poltroon.
But since thou bringest me the Amulet I desired,
I shall let thee live. Thou mayst leave the Dungeon now.'

SHIT! Due to a silly mistake, you failed so close to your goal!
You forgot to make sure that the high altar is actually
consecrated to %d, and offered the Amulet of Yendor to the wrong
deity!

Do you want your possessions identified? DYWYPI?
Game over! Please insert a coin to start a new game.

%Cc Sag 00116
As you step on this particular floor tile, the ground is suddenly
vibrating right beneath you.

This must be the special place where the entrance to
Moloch's sanctum is hidden! In order to open it, you need all three
of the invocation tools: Book, Bell and Candle. And then you have
to use all three of them in rapid succession while standing on
this exact floor tile.

Additionally, the bell must be imbued before you can complete
the invocation rituals. It needs to be done inside the Subquest,
a branch from where the bell can be found; specifically, the
Bell Caves is the location where imbuing takes place.

You must also make sure to attach seven candles
to the candelabrum, otherwise it won't do what it ought to do.
And the invocation tools better don't be cursed...
%E
%Cc Sag 00117
This peculiar gray stone makes you feel both good and bad at once.
It must surely have great magical power, but there seems to be
some sort of curse on it too.
Maybe if you somehow lift the curse, it will become a truly
useful talisman that can protect you from harm?

It is written in the Book of %d:

    After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
    against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
    Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
    the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
    and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
    Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.

Your %G %d seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.

You, a newly trained %r, have been heralded

It is written in the Book of %d:

Grave times have befallen our school. There is an evil
group of girls called the Hussies, and they constantly
attempt to steal the diamonds that were hidden by the
forefathers who once founded this school. The Hussies
use their femininity as a weapon to get what they want,
and few have been able to resist them.

%d has decreed that this has to stop.
The Hussies need to be defeated once and for all, and
since %p is a promising Walscholar, it is now
their obligation to get rid of the Hussy threat.

The supreme leader of the Hussies is called Anna, a
beautiful girl that likes perfume and usually wears
lovely boots. But she commands all the other Hussies
and instructs them to attack relentlessly, which is
why %p has to defeat her anyway. If that can
be accomplished, the school's diamonds will be safe.

However, the Hussies have hired additional help in
the form of the hola-hola brigade, who are going to
try to convert %p to their weird religion.
Hopefully %p can fight or sneak past all the
opposition and infiltrate the depths of this school,
also known as "Gehennom", where Anna keeps her
source of power: the Amulet of Yendor.
The Amulet then needs to be brought up to the high
altar to %d, who will lock it away in a place where
Anna will never be able to get her hands on it again.
Once that is done, the Hussies will cease to be a
threat and peace will be restored at last.

For the sake of us all:  Rescue our school in the name of %d!

It is written in the Book of %d:

This is the story of %p, one of the most promising
students attending our school. Since the beginning of
time, %p has been like a %S to me. Unfortunately,
my %S is in the worst class of the entire school.

The core problem is that this class is home to the
feared Bang Gang, a group of pupils who would not come
to learn things. Rather, they want to bully everyone
who doesn't belong to them. %p has always been one
of their victims, with me trying my best to protect
my %S from harm.

Recently, though, things have escalated. It seems that
leading Bang Gang members decided to declare %p their
public enemy number one, and in order to force my %S
to quit school entirely, they hired help. For this school
also houses the Hussy Club, a group of girls who will
fulfill any request for the right price, as long as it
involves making someone's life hard. And obviously,
the Bang Gang was the highest bidder.

As a result, %p now has to endure the attacks of Anna
and her fellow hussies as well, in addition to whatever
cruel things the Bang Gangers are doing. The hussies
happily steal my %S's pocket money, or humiliate %p
in public, or whatever floats their mind. This is
intolerable, and the evil perpetrators have to be stopped.

Therefore, %p will have to undertake a perilous journey
and complete a very difficult task. For Anna's source of
power is hidden deep in this school, in an area commonly
named "Gehennom". My %S has to venture there, avoid or
defeat all of Anna's guards and the members of the Bang Gang
that want to prevent the Amulet of Yendor from being stolen,
and bring it to me.

Once that has been done, Anna will lose all of her special
powers, and her hussies will be unable to bully my pupils
ever again. This is no easy mission for %p, I'm aware of that,
but I'll use my power to protect my %S from Anna and the
Bang Gangers along the grueling path that lies ahead.

For the sake of us all:  Rescue our school in the name of %d!

It is written in the Book of %d:

    After the Creation, the cruel god Moloch rebelled
    against the authority of Marduk the Creator.
    Moloch stole from Marduk the most powerful of all
    the artifacts of the gods, the Amulet of Yendor,
    and he hid it in the dark cavities of Gehennom, the
    Under World, where he now lurks, and bides his time.

Your %G %d seeks to possess the Amulet, and with it
to gain deserved ascendance over the other gods.

You, a newly escaped %r, have chosen to redeem
yourself by recovering the Amulet for %d.  You are
determined to recover the Amulet for your deity, or die
in the attempt.  Your hour of destiny has come.  For
the sake of us all:  Go bravely with %d!
%E

%Cc - 00197
You fail at reading comprehension forever. The Amulet
of Yendor needs to be imbued, and you were told about that
many times!!! Now you have to take it back all the way
to Moloch's sanctum, enter the Yendorian Tower, and
imbue it by finding and entering the Forging Chamber,
Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos.
%E
%Cc - 00196
Remember: The Amulet of Yendor needs to be imbued first.
As long as that has not been done, you will not be able
to reach the Elemental Planes to deliver the amulet to %d.
Seek the hidden magic portal on Moloch's sanctum to gain
access to the Yendorian Tower. From there, you need to
look for three special staircases that lead to
the Forging Chamber, Dead Grounds and Ordered Chaos.
Enter each of these areas while holding the Amulet of Yendor,
and it will be imbued. After completing that process, you
need to head to the surface.
%E
%Cc - 00195
It seems that this magical bell needs to be imbued, otherwise
it simply won't work. In order to imbue it, you need to
search the Quest levels 2-6 and find a magic portal somewhere,
which will take you to the Subquest. Somewhere in that Subquest,
a staircase is hidden that will take you to the Bell Caves.
Entering the Bell Caves will imbue the bell, allowing it to work.
