abbathor
	Abbathor is the sole evil dwarven god, the great master of the
	greed and avarice that plagues so many of that otherwise noble
	race. He is a hunched, twisted creature, warped by his own
	greeds, jealousies, and desires. Like many other deities, his
	name is often invoked by followers of other gods to keep him away
	from one's treasure.
abbot
	For it had been long apparent to Count Landulf that nothing
	could be done with his seventh son Thomas, except to make him
	an Abbot or something of that kind.  Born in 1226, he had from
	childhood a mysterious objection to becoming a predatory eagle,
	or even to taking an ordinary interest in falconry or tilting
	or any other gentlemanly pursuits.  He was a large and heavy and
	quiet boy, and phenomenally silent, scarcely opening his mouth
	except to say suddenly to his schoolmaster in an explosive
	manner, "What is God?"  The answer is not recorded but it is
	probable that the asker went on worrying out answers for himself.

armor*
armour*
suit or piece of armor
	"The last spot on the school jousting team came down to another 
	boy and me. He was poor, and his only armor was a blanket his 
	mother had made him from her hair. I, on the other hand, had 
	a brand new suit of chain mail. Just before our joust, I asked 
	him what he'd do if he made the team. (I was hoping to be more 
	popular with the ladies.) He said he would be able to save the 
	town from dragons and be able to afford some water for his 20 
	brothers and sisters.

	Well, a sense of compassion came over me. I insisted we swap 
	armor. He was forced to accept, as it would have been an 
	insult not to do so.

	On the battlefield, we charged at each other and we both connected 
	with our lances.

	Lying there on the mud mortally wounded, I learned what true armor 
	class was that day."

adom*
ancient domain*
	A roguelike. It's closed source and the full version costs money,
	but maybe you'll like it. There is also Elona, which is kinda
	similar but open source and free. Some ADOM versions have a bug
	that can crash the game and erase your save; you might want to
	backup your saves regularly to remedy that.
aerdrie faenya
	Aerdrie  Faenya is the elven goddess of air and weather. As a rain-
	bringer, she is revered as a source of fertility.  She is, however,
	perceived as a somewhat distant  goddess, and the fact that she  is
	also revered by some aarakocra slightly diminishes the  strength of
	elven  devotion to  her (as does  her definite  neutral tendency in
	alignment). The goddess  herself takes  delight in  the freedom  of
	the skies, the music  of wind instruments,  and (sometimes)  fairly
	severe and  violent thunderstorms. She is  friendly to all  avians,
	aarakocra, ki-rin, and lammasu.

aclys
aklys
	A short studded or spiked club attached to a cord allowing
	it to be drawn back to the wielder after having been thrown.
	It should not be confused with the atlatl, which is a device
	used to throw spears for longer distances.
aglaope
siren
	In Greek mythology, the Sirens were three dangerous bird-women, 
	portrayed as seductresses who lured nearby sailors with their 
	enchanting music and voices to shipwreck on the rocky coast of 
	their island. [...] In some later, rationalized traditions, the
	literal geography of the "flowery" island of Anthemoessa, or 
	Anthemusa, is fixed: sometimes on Cape Pelorum and at others in 
	the islands known as the Sirenuse, near Paestum, or in Capreae.
	All such locations were surrounded by cliffs and rocks.

	Their number is variously reported as between two and five. 
	In the Odyssey, Homer says nothing of their origin or names, 
	but gives the number of the Sirens as two.  Later writers mention
	both their names and number: some state that there were three, 
	Peisinoe, Aglaope, and Thelxiepeia or Parthenope, Ligeia, and 
	Leucosia.

~agate ring
agate*
	Translucent, cryptocrystalline variety of quartz and a subvariety
	of chalcedony. Agates are identical in chemical structure to jasper,
	flint, chert, petrified wood, and tiger's-eye, and are often found in
	association with opal. The colorful, banded rocks are used as a
	semiprecious gemstone and in the manufacture of grinding equipment.
	An agate's banding forms as silica from solution is slowly deposited
	into cavities and veins in older rock.
		[ The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition ]
ais*
	ais523 maintains the variant Nethack 4. It's rather similar to
	vanilla NetHack, but with a curses-like interface. Amy ascended it
	several times.

	On another note, ais523 did a speedrun of vanilla NetHack that
	includes showing off various glitches, such as the infinite gold
	(or antigold) glitch, successfully wishing for a wand of wishing,
	using a throne or fountain as an infinite wish engine, and
	doing various telewarps to skip the entire ascension run and pass
	through the elemental planes in zero game time. No one knows the
	internal mechanics of NetHack better than he does. If you want to
	do your own NetHack speedrun or need to know internal code-related
	stuff about the game, ais523 is the man to talk to. Last but not
	least, he invented the "evil variant", although he never actually
	released it and most of it has not even been coded. SLEX includes
	several of his Sokoban levels, which are variants of the infamous
	"vanilla nightmare" level that look almost the same but have
	completely different, much more difficult solutions.
*leax
	An Aleax,  according to the  AD&D Fiend Folio,  is a  creature that

	She is the main developer of SLEX, and while it's true that she's
	from Germany, all the other stuff that's being said on 4chan is
	just delusional speculation. She likes fleecy bundles of shoes,
	and also keeps adding more and more stuff to her game, causing
	some to assert that it becomes "too bloated". In particular, she
	loves coding new nasty traps that make the game harder, often in
	spectacularly unfair ways.
anachronist
anachrononaut
	Originally called anachronist in dnethack, but it got changed
	to anachrononono-nononono (that word is really hard to spell).
	Here in the land of SLEX, they're still called anachronist. It's a guy
	from the future, and apparently that "future" is rather different
	from ours, since the anachrononono-nononono can't eat normally in
	dnethack and has a bunch of other restrictions. SLEX anachronists,
	on the other hand, aren't all that special apart from having unusual

	The wrath of Anhur is slow to come, but it is inescapable

	of the sun.  He is married to Mehut, a lion-headed goddess.
ankh-morpork
	The twin city of Ankh-Morpork, foremost of all the cities
	bounding the Circle Sea, was as a matter of course the home
	of a large number of gangs, thieves' guilds, syndicates and
	similar organisations.  This was one of the reasons for its
	wealth.  Most of the humbler folk on the widdershin side of

	samurai clans he rebelled against him.  He defeated Go-
	Daigo and established the emperor Komyo on the throne.
	Go-Daigo eventually escaped and established another
	government in the town of Yoshino.  This period of dual
	governments was known as the Nambokucho.
	[ Samurai - The Story of a Warrior Tradition, by Cook ]
	On July 8, 1336,  he and his samurai entered Kyoto, forced Go-Daigo

	puppet prince on the throne  (the current Japanese  imperial family
	are  the   descendants  of  this   puppet  emperor  that   Ashikaga
	installed).

	and  opened a new "capital"  in Yoshino (south of  Kyoto), where he
	and few  of his  descendants claimed  to be  running a  government,
	known as  the "Southern Court". The  period between  1337 and 1392,
	when Japan was ruled by two courts, is known as the Nambokucho.

	That "government" disappeared, naturally, after a  few generations,

athol
	In 1927, zoologist Ernst Bartels was in his home near the

	the other night sounds, a cry like "a-hool."
	Bartels heard the sound twice more before the origin of the cries 
	moved off into the night. Bartels soon remembered a local legend 
	of the ahool or athol, a type of huge bat reputed to live in 
	the area.

	Locals described the bat as the size of a small child, with 
	an 11-12 foot wingspan. The athol was supposedly covered in 
	grayish fur and had a face similar to that of a monkey or a man. 
	At times, it was seen sitting on the forest floor, with its wings 
	folded beside it; it was also reputed to have feet which pointed
	backwards. During the day (like all bats, it was nocturnal), the 
	athol's refuge was supposedly a cave somewhere near a waterfall, 
	although at night it would fly over the river's surface in
	search of fish.

augurer
      Augurers are diviners and seekers of truth. The are very similar to an 
      Archaeologist, in that they delve into the dungeons in search of secrets. 
      However knowledge and wisdom are far more important to them than precious 
      metals or relics. Augurers have some enigmatic abilities that set them 
      apart from other individuals, abilities that go beyond the realm of 
      "normal" magic or the regular psyche. Augurers are blessed with an uncanny 
      luck, a deep insight into the world and events around them and an 
      insatiable thirst for knowledge.

      They are relatively well-rounded people, as wandering seekers of knowledge 
      they are both strong of mind and of body. However the rigour and stress 
      often leave them uncoordinated.

	Ancient Baalphegor, canny and inventive, here since the beginning.
		[ Rip Van Wormer ]

	Baalphegor is a dignified she-devil with cinnamon-colored skin, 
	red eyes and hair, as well as bat wings. She appears young and 
	carefree but when angered, her eyes glow with flames and her 
	usually musical voice becomes very harsh. She is only five and 
	a half feet in height.
	
	Baalphegor is said to have been around since the creation of 
	Baator itself. She's a very skilled diplomat and tactician, and 
	an unmatched sorceress. She has created many artifacts and 
	techniques used throughout the Nine Hells. In addition to her 
	status, this fact granted her a deep respect from almost everyone
	in Baator, even from Asmodeus, who appreciates her to the point 
	of letting her live with her ever-scheming consort.
	
	Knowing all too well her master's position, Baalphegor keeps her 
	goals to herself, acting with a minimal degree of loyalty to the 
	Lord of the Eighth. Mephistopheles tolerates this due to the 
	protection given by his consort's presence.

bear trap
	Probably most commonly associated with trapping, the leghold
	trap is a rather simple mechanical trap. It is made up of two
	jaws, a spring of some sort, and a trigger in the middle. When
	the animal steps on the trigger the trap closes around the leg,
	holding the animal in place. Usually some kind of lure is used
	to position the animal, or the trap is set on an animal trail.
	Traditionally, leghold traps had tightly closing "teeth" to make
	sure the animal stayed in place. The teeth also made sure the
	animal could not move the leg in the trap and ruin their fur.
	However, this resulted in many animals gnawing off legs in order
	to escape. More modern traps have a gap called an "offset jaw"
	and work more like a handcuff. They grip above the paw, making
	sure the animal cannot pull out but does not destroy the leg.
	This also allows the trapper to release unwanted catches.

	The tissue injury resulting from frostbite is produced in two ways. The most

	osmotic and chemical imbalances resulting from  extraction of water from within 
	the cell injure them, but permanent damage may be small. (...) The second 
	mechanism of tissue injury by frostbite, which is much more significant is loss
	of blood supply to the tissues. Blood may flow through larger vessels but (one 
	of the signs of adequate rewarming is a flushing of the frozen area) oxygen 
	cannot be deliver to the tissues because the small blood vessels that would

	The Archchancellor leaned towards him.
	"Eh?" he said.

blindfold
	The blindfolding was performed by binding a piece of the
	yellowish linen whereof those of the Amahagger who condescended
	to wear anything in particular made their dresses tightly round
	the eyes.  This linen I afterwards discovered was taken from the
	tombs, and was not, as I had first supposed, of native
	manufacture.  The bandage was then knotted at the back of the
	head, and finally brought down again and the ends bound under
	the chin to prevent its slipping.  Ustane was, by the way, also
	blindfolded, I do not know why, unless it was from fear that she
	should impart the secrets of the route to us.

blind io
	On this particular day Blind Io, by dint of constant vigilance
	the chief of the gods, sat with his chin on his hand
	and looked at the gaming board on the red marble table in
	front of him.  Blind Io had got his name because, where his
	eye sockets should have been, there were nothing but two
	areas of blank skin.  His eyes, of which he had an impressively
	large number, led a semi-independent life of their
	own.  Several were currently hovering above the table.

bullshit
	Bullshit (also bullcrap) is a common English expletive which may be
	shortened to the euphemism bull or the initialism BS.
	In British English, "bollocks" is a comparable expletive.
	It is mostly a slang profanity term meaning "nonsense",
	especially as a rebuke in response to communication or actions
	viewed as deceptive, misleading, disingenuous, unfair or false.
	As with many expletives, the term can be used as an interjection,
	or as many other parts of speech, and can carry a wide variety
	of meanings. A person who communicates nonsense on a given subject
	may be referred to as a "bullshit artist".

bugbear
	Bugbears are relatives of goblins, although they tend to be
	larger and more hairy.  They are aggressive carnivores and
	sometimes kill just for the treasure their victims may be
	carrying.

	Bugbears are giant, hairy  cousins of goblins who frequent the same
	areas  as  their smaller  relatives.  Bugbears are  large and  very
	muscular, standing 7' tall.  Their hides range from light yellow to
	yellow brown  and their  thick coarse  hair varies  in colour  from
	brown  to  brick  red.  Though  vaguely   humanoid  in  appearance,
	bugbears seem to contain the  blood of some large  carnivore. Their
	eyes recall  those of  some savage  bestial animal, being  greenish
	white with  red pupils, while their  ears are  wedge shaped, rising
	from the  top of  their heads. A  bugbear's mouth  is full of  long
	sharp fangs.
	Bugbears have two main goals  in life: survival and  treasure. They
	are  superb  carnivores,  winnowing  out  the   weak  and  careless
	adventurer, monster, and animal. Goblins  are always on  their toes
	when  bugbears are present, for  the weak or  stupid quickly end up

candy bar
	Only once a year, on his birthday, did Charlie Bucket ever
	get to taste a bit of chocolate.  The whole family saved up
	their money for that special occasion, and when the great
	day arrived, Charlie was always presented with one small
	chocolate bar to eat all by himself.  And each time he
	received it, on those marvelous birthday mornings, he would
	place it carefully in a small wooden box that he owned, and
	treasure it as though it were a bar of solid gold; and for
	the next few days, he would allow himself only to look at it,
	but never to touch it.  Then at last, when he could stand it
	no longer, he would peel back a tiny bit of the paper
	wrapping at one corner to expose a tiny bit of chocolate, and
	then he would take a tiny nibble - just enough to allow the
	lovely sweet taste to spread out slowly over his tongue.  The
	next day, he would take another tiny nibble, and so on, and
	so on.  And in this way, Charlie would make his ten-cent bar
	of birthday chocolate last him for more than a month.

	the cat is killed.  If the event does not take place, the cat lives
	on.  In Schroedinger's original version, the quantum event was the

	is indeed in a linear combination of being alive and dead, and only
	when the container is finally opened would the cat's state vector
	collapse into one or the other.  On the other hand, to a (suitably
	protected) observer inside the container, the cat's state-vector
	would have collapsed much earlier, and the outside observer's

babelfish
 		"The Babel fish," said The Hitch  Hiker's Guide  to  the  Galaxy
 		quietly,  "is  small,  yellow  and  leech-like, and probably the

 		unconscious mental frequencies  from this  brainwave  energy  to
 		nourish  itself  with.  It then  excretes  into  the mind of its
 		carrier a telepathic matrix formed  by  combining the  conscious
 		thought frequencies with nerve signals picked up from the speech
 		centres of the brain which  has  supplied  them.  The  practical
 		upshot of all this is that if you stick a Babel fish in your ear
 		you can instantly understand anything said to you in any form of
 		language.  The  speech  patterns  you actually  hear  decode the
 		brainwave matrix which has been fed into your mind by your Babel
 		fish.

	Elder Goddess of cats, earthly knowledge of the true name

	the correct pronunciation of the unprecidented hieroglyphs 
	found in the being's name, have long since been lost, though

*centaur
	Of all the monsters put together by the Greek imagination
	the Centaurs (Kentauroi) constituted a class in themselves.
	Despite a strong streak of sensuality, in their make-up,
	their normal behaviour was moral, and they took a kindly
	thought of man's welfare.  The attempted outrage of Nessos on
	Deianeira, and that of the whole tribe of Centaurs on the
	Lapith women, are more than offset by the hospitality of
	Pholos and by the wisdom of Cheiron, physician, prophet,
	lyrist, and the instructor of Achilles.  Further, the
	Centaurs were peculiar in that their nature, which united the
	body of a horse with the trunk and head of a man, involved
	an unthinkable duplication of vital organs and important
	members.  So grotesque a combination seems almost un-Greek.
	These strange creatures were said to live in the caves and
	clefts of the mountains, myths associating them especially
	with the hills of Thessaly and the range of Erymanthos.

	why this is so, but although the fierce weasel can slay the
	basilisk, it will itself be killed in the struggle.  Perhaps
	the weasel knows the basilisk's fatal weakness:  if it ever
	sees its own reflection in a mirror it will perish instantly.
	But even a dead basilisk is dangerous, for it is said that
	merely touching its lifeless body can cause a person to
	sicken and die.

contamination
	Caused by weeping angels and certain other monsters' attacks,
	but you can also be contaminated by triggering certain traps or by
	having items made of ether out in the open. Wearing ether items will
	give particularly high rates of contamination. Don't eat monsters that
	have contamination attacks lest you be fatally contaminated.

	While contaminated, your wisdom will slowly decrease, and there is no
	magical way of restoring it. If wisdom drops below 3, you die.
	Being sufficiently contaminated will also prevent you from exercising
	wisdom, or any other stat for that matter. While a little contamination
	isn't too dangerous, get contaminated enough and you're in trouble.
	High amounts of contamination additionally slow down your hit point and
	mana recovery rates, eventually to a point where you have next to no
	regeneration whatsoever.

	It can be cured by reading the scroll of remove curse (which may not be
	cursed itself), or you can also zap the wand of remove curse if you
	happen to find one of those. Praying on an altar to your own deity
	will fix it if the prayer is successful. And a few obscure ways of
	curing contamination exist as well; amnesia might also fix it in a
	pinch, though I forgot whether the source can be trusted.

	"Give it", he said, "and give me your name as well".

dilithium*
	The most famous and the first to be named of the imaginary

	within the mythology, as there are various episodes that
	make reference to the mining of dilithium deposits. ...
	This name itself is imaginary and gives no real information on
	the structure or make-up of this substance other than that this
	version of the name implies a lithium and iron-bearing
	aluminosilicate of some sort. That said, the real mineral that 
	most closely matches the descriptive elements of this name is
	ferroholmquistite which is a dilithium triferrodiallosilicate. 
	If one goes on the premise that nature follows certain general 
	norms, then one could extrapolate that dilithium might have a 
	similar number of silicon atoms in its structure.
	Keeping seven (i.e. hepto) ferrous irons and balancing the 
	oxygens would give a theoretical formula of Li2Fe7Al2Si8O27. A

*dragon
*xoth
	In the West the dragon was the natural enemy of man.  Although
	preferring to live in bleak and desolate regions, whenever it
	was seen among men it left in its wake a trail of destruction
	and disease.  Yet any attempt to slay this beast was a perilous
	undertaking.  For the dragon's assailant had to contend
	not only with clouds of sulphurous fumes pouring from its fire
	breathing nostrils, but also with the thrashings of its tail,
	the most deadly part of its serpent-like body.
	[ Mythical Beasts by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]

	"One whom the dragons will speak with," he said, "that is a
	dragonlord, or at least that is the center of the matter.  It's
	not a trick of mastering the dragons, as most people think.
	Dragons have no masters.  The question is always the same, with
	a dragon:  will he talk to you or will he eat you?  If you can
	count upon his doing the former, and not doing the latter, why
	then you're a dragonlord."

	An individual dread blossom looks like a foot long
	crimson flower, speckled with gold and black pollen,
	that ends in a 6-inch-long hollow thorn surrounded at
	its base by a frill of inch-long roots. Few creatures can
	examine a dread blossom in such detail, as a dread blossom
	swarm at rest is usually firmly planted in the bodies
	of its latest victims.

 		"The time is nearly upon us," said one, and Arthur was surprised
 		to see a word suddenly materialize in thin air just by the man's
 		neck. The word was Loonquawl, and it flashed a couple  of  times
 		and then disappeared again. Before Arthur was able to assimilate
 		this the other man spoke and the word  Phouchg  appeared by  his
 		neck.
  
 		"Seventy-five thousand generations ago, our ancestors  set  this

 		will be the first to hear the computer speak."
  
 		"An awesome prospect, Phouchg," agreed the first man, and Arthur

 		"We are the ones who will hear," said Phouchg,"the answer to the

 		"And Everything ...!"
  
 		"Shhh," said Loonquawl with  a  slight  gesture, "I  think  Deep

 		There was a  moment's expectant  pause whilst panels slowly came
 		to life on the front of  the  console. Lights flashed on and off
 		experimentally and settled down into a businesslike  pattern.  A
 		soft low hum came from the communication channel.
  
 		"Good morning," said Deep Thought at last.
  
 		"Er ... Good morning, O Deep Thought," said Loonquawl nervously,
 		"do you have ... er, that is ..."
  
 		"An answer for you?" interrupted Deep Thought majestically."Yes.
 		I have."
  
 		The two men shivered with expectancy. Their waiting had not been

 		"There really is one?" breathed Phouchg.
  
 		"There really is one," confirmed Deep Thought.
  
 		"To Everything? To the great Question of Life, the  Universe and

 		"Yes."

 		been  a  preparation  for it, they had been selected at birth as
 		those who would witness the  answer,  but  even  so  they  found

 		"And you're ready to give it to us?" urged Loonquawl.
  
 		"I am."
  
 		"Now?"
  
 		"Now," said Deep Thought.
  
 		They both licked their dry lips.
  
 		"Though I don't think," added Deep Thought,"that you're going to

 		"Doesn't matter!" said Phouchg. "We must know it! Now!"
  
 		"Now?" inquired Deep Thought.
  
 		"Yes! Now ..."
  
 		"Alright," said the computer and settled into silence again. The
 		two men fidgeted. The tension was unbearable.
  
 		"You're really not going to like it," observed Deep Thought.
  
 		"Tell us!"
  
 		"Alright," said Deep Thought. "The Answer to the  Great Question

dwarf*
dwar* cave*man
	Dwarfs have faces like men (ugly men, with wrinkled, leathery
	skins), but are generally either flat-footed, duck-footed, or
	have feet pointing backwards.  They are of the earth, earthy,
	living in the darkest of caverns and venturing forth only
	with the cloaks by which they can make themselves invisible,
	and others disguised as toads.  Miners often come across them,
	and sometimes establish reasonably close relations with them.
	... The miners of Cornwall were always delighted to hear a
	bucca busily mining away, for all dwarfs have an infallible
	nose for precious metals.
	Among other things, dwarfs are rightly valued for their skill
	as blacksmiths and jewellers: they made Odin his famous spear
	Gungnir, and Thor his hammer; for Freya they designed a
	magnificent necklace, and for Frey a golden boar.  And in their
	spare time they are excellent bakers.  Ironically, despite
	their odd feet, they are particularly fond of dancing.  They
	can also see into the future, and consequently are excellent
	meteorologists.  They can be free with presents to people
	they like, and a dwarvish gift is likely to turn to gold in
	the hand.  But on the whole they are a snappish lot.

earendil

	In after days, when because of the triumph of Morgoth Elves and
	Men became estranged, as he most wished, those of the Elven-race
	that lived still in Middle-earth waned and faded, and Men usurped
	the sunlight.  Then the Quendi wandered in the lonely places of the
	great lands and the isles, and took to the moonlight and the
	starlight, and to the woods and the caves, becoming as shadows
	and memories, save those who ever and anon set sail into the West
	and vanished from Middle-earth.  But in the dawn of years Elves
	and Men were allies and held themselves akin, and there were some
	among Men that learned the wisdom of the Eldar, and became great
	and valiant among the captains of the Noldor.  And in the glory
	and beauty of the Elves, and in their fate, full share had the

	after a slumber of uncounted years its time had again come.

fountain
	Rest! This little Fountain runs
	Thus for aye: -- It never stays
	For the look of summer suns,
	Nor the cold of winter days.
	Whose'er shall wander near,
	When the Syrian heat is worst,
	Let him hither come, nor fear
	Lest he may not slake his thirst:
	He will find this little river
	Running still, as bright as ever.
	Let him drink, and onward hie,
	Bearing but in thought, that I,
	Erotas, bade the Naiad fall,
	And thank the great god Pan for all!

*fourk*
jonadab
	Nethack Fourk is one of the NH4-based NetHack variants, created by
	jonadab. Amy has had a bit of trouble with it at first but then
	managed to ascend it several times. Fourk implements the wand
	balance patch that changes the way wands work, and it makes ranged
	combat much more feasible by greatly reducing the odds of your
	shuriken mulching, plus you have magic chests that ease the carry
	capacity problem. Plus it adds a few new monsters and other
	interesting features. You should definitely give it a try.
	As of the time of writing, Amy considers it one of the best
	NetHack variants, along with Grunthack and dnethack.

	There might be achievement unlockables in a future Nethack Fourk
	version. Also, maybe it will merge FIQhack's player-monster
	symmetry changes.
fox
	One hot summer's day a Fox was strolling through an orchard till he
	came to a bunch of Grapes just ripening on a vine which had been
	trained over a lofty branch. "Just the thing to quench my thirst,"
	quoth he. Drawing back a few paces, he took a run and a jump, and
	just missed the bunch. Turning round again with a One, Two, Three, he
	jumped up, but with no greater success. Again and again he tried
	after the tempting morsel, but at last had to give it up, and walked
	away with his nose in the air, saying: "I am sure they are sour."
		[ Aesop's Fables ]

	Later on, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat
	and went to visit his wife. He said, "I'm going to my wife's
	room."  But her father would not let him go in.
	"I was so sure you thoroughly hated her," he said, "that I gave
	her to your friend. Isn't her younger sister more attractive? Take
	her instead."
	Samson said to them, "This time I have a right to get even with
	the Philistines; I will really harm them." So he went out and
	caught three hundred foxes and tied them tail to tail in pairs. He
	then fastened a torch to every pair of tails, lit the torches and
	let the foxes loose in the standing grain of the Philistines.

~phantom fungus
*fung*
	Fungi, division of simple plants that lack chlorophyll, true
	stems, roots, and leaves.  Unlike algae, fungi cannot
	photosynthesize, and live as parasites or saprophytes.  The
	division comprises the slime molds and true fungi.  True
	fungi are multicellular (with the exception of yeasts); the
	body of most true fungi consists of slender cottony
	filaments, or hyphae.  All fungi are capable of asexual
	reproduction by cell division, budding, fragmentation, or
	spores.  Those that reproduce sexually alternate a sexual
	generation (gametophyte) with a spore-producing one.  The
	four classes of true fungi are the algaelike fungi (e.g.,
	black bread mold and downy mildew), sac fungi (e.g., yeasts,
	powdery mildews, truffles, and blue and green molds such as
	Penicillium), basidium fungi (e.g., mushrooms and puffballs)
	and imperfect fungi (e.g., species that cause athlete's foot
	and ringworm).  Fungi help decompose organic matter (important
	in soil renewal); are valuable as a source of antibiotics,
	vitamins, and various chemicals; and for their role in
	fermentation, e.g., in bread and alcoholic beverage
	production.

gang scholar
	This is the story of Player 1, one of the most promising
	students attending our school. Since the beginning of
	time, Player 1 has been like a child to me. Unfortunately,
	my child is in the worst class of the entire school.

	The core problem is that this class is home to the
	feared Bang Gang, a group of pupils who would not come
	to learn things. Rather, they want to bully everyone
	who doesn't belong to them. Player 1 has always been one
	of their victims, with me trying my best to protect
	my child from harm.

	Recently, though, things have escalated. It seems that
	leading Bang Gang members decided to declare Player 1 their
	public enemy number one, and in order to force my child
	to quit school entirely, they hired help. For this school
	also houses the Hussy Club, a group of girls who will
	fulfill any request for the right price, as long as it
	involves making someone's life hard. And obviously,
	the Bang Gang was the highest bidder.

	As a result, Player 1 now has to endure the attacks of Anna
	and her fellow hussies as well, in addition to whatever
	cruel things the Bang Gangers are doing. The hussies
	happily steal my child's pocket money, or humiliate Player 1
	in public, or whatever floats their mind. This is
	intolerable, and the evil perpetrators have to be stopped.

	Therefore, Player 1 will have to undertake a perilous journey
	and complete a very difficult task. For Anna's source of
	power is hidden deep in this school, in an area commonly
	named "Gehennom". My child has to venture there, avoid or
	defeat all of Anna's guards and the members of the Bang Gang
	that want to prevent the Amulet of Yendor from being stolen,
	and bring it to me.

	Once that has been done, Anna will lose all of her special
	powers, and her hussies will be unable to bully my pupils
	ever again. This is no easy mission for Player 1, I'm aware of that,
	but I'll use my power to protect my child from Anna and the
	Bang Gangers along the grueling path that lies ahead.

	For the sake of us all:  Rescue our school in the name of your deity!

*gargoyle
	And so it came to pass that while Man ruled on Earth, the
	gargoyles waited, lurking, hidden from the light.  Reborn
	every 600 years in Man's reckoning of time, the gargoyles
	joined battle against Man to gain dominion over the Earth.

	In each coming, the gargoyles were nearly destroyed by Men
	who flourished in greater numbers.  Now it has been so many
	hundreds of years that it seems the ancient statues and
	paintings of gargoyles are just products of Man's
	imagination.  In this year, with Man's thoughts turned toward
	the many ills he has brought among himself, Man has forgotten
	his most ancient adversary, the gargoyles.

	1 November - All day long we have travelled, and at a good
	speed.  The horses seem to know that they are being kindly
	treated, for they go willingly their full stage at best
	speed.  We have now had so many changes and find the same
	thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the
	journey will be an easy one.  Dr. Van Helsing is laconic, he
	tells the farmers that he is hurrying to Bistritz, and pays
	them well to make the exchange of horses.  We get hot soup,
	or coffee, or tea, and off we go.  It is a lovely country.
	Full of beauties of all imaginable kinds, and the people are
	brave, and strong, and simple, and seem full of nice
	qualities.  They are very, very superstitious.  In the first
	house where we stopped, when the woman who served us saw the
	scar on my forehead, she crossed herself and put out two
	fingers towards me, to keep off the evil eye.  I believe they
	went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into
	our food, and I can't abide garlic.  Ever since then I have
	taken care not to take off my hat or veil, and so have
	escaped their suspicions.

*genocide
	A word invented by Professor Raphael Lemkin of Duke University,
	U.S.A., and used in the drafting of the official indictment of war
	criminals in 1945. It is a combination of Gr. _genos_, race; and
	Lat. _caedere_, to kill. It is defined as acts intended to destroy,
	in whole or in part, national, ethnical, racial, or religious
	groups, and in 1948 was declared by the United Nations General
	Assembly to be a crime of international law.

	Geryon is an arch-devil sometimes called the Wild Beast,

githyanki*
	Githyanki are an ancient race descended from humans. They dwell 
	upon the Astral plane but will often leave that plane to make war 
	on other races. They are engaged in a lengthy war with the 
	githzerai.

	Githyanki are strongly humanoid in appearance. They are 
	approximately of human height but tend to be much more gaunt and 
	long of limb. They have rough, yellow skin and gleaming black 
	eyes that instantly betray their inhumanness. Like many demihuman 
	races, their ears have sharp points and are serrated at the back. 
	Dress for the githyanki is always an elaborate affair. Their 
	baroque armor and weapons of war are decorated with feathers, 
	beads, and precious metals and gems.

	History provides some information on the githyanki - their race 
	is both ancient and reclusive. Sages believe they once were 
	humans that were captured by mind flayers to serve as slaves and 
	cattle. The mind flayers treated their human slaves cruelly and 
	the people harbored a deep resentment toward the illithids. For 
	centuries these humans increased their hatred but could not 
	summon the strength necessary to break free. So they waited for 
	many years, developing their power in secret, waiting for an 
	opportunity to strike out against their masters. Finally, a woman 
	of power came forth among them, a deliverer by the name of Gith. 
	She convinced the people to rise up against their cruel masters. 
	The struggle was long and vicious, but eventually the people 
	freed themselves. They had earned their freedom and become the 
	githyanki, (which, in their tongue, means sons of Gith).
~*truck ghost
*ghost
	And now the souls of the dead who had gone below came swarming
	up from Erebus -- fresh brides, unmarried youths, old men
	with life's long suffering behind them, tender young girls
	still nursing this first anguish in their hearts, and a great
	throng of warriors killed in battle, their spear-wounds gaping
	yet and all their armour stained with blood.  From this
	multitude of souls, as they fluttered to and fro by the
	trench, there came a moaning that was horrible to hear.
	Panic drained the blood from my cheeks.
		 [ The Odyssey, (chapter Lambda), by Homer ]
ghoul*
	The forces of the gloom know each other, and are strangely
	balanced by each other.  Teeth and claws fear what they cannot
	grasp.  Blood-drinking bestiality, voracious appetites, hunger
	in search of prey, the armed instincts of nails and jaws which
	have for source and aim the belly, glare and smell out
	uneasily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a
	shroud, erect in its vague and shuddering robe, and which seem
	to them to live with a dead and terrible life.  These
	brutalities, which are only matter, entertain a confused fear
	of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an
	unknown being.  A black figure barring the way stops the wild
	beast short.  That which emerges from the cemetery intimidates
	and disconcerts that which emerges from the cave; the
	ferocious fear the sinister; wolves recoil when they encounter
	a ghoul.
		[ Les Miserables, by Victor Hugo ]
*giant kraken
	An enormously fearsome and powerful inhabitant of the depths. It 
	resembles a gargantuan octopus and its evil is almost tangible. 
*giant
giant humanoid
	Giants have always walked the earth, though they are rare in
	these times.  They range in size from little over nine feet
	to a towering twenty feet or more.  The larger ones use huge
	boulders as weapons, hurling them over large distances.  All
	types of giants share a love for men - roasted, boiled, or
	fried.  Their table manners are legendary.
gila*
	[Gila monsters] are stout-bodied lizards with short legs and a short,
	fat tail. They're covered with bright irregular markings, usually
	pink, yellow or white, against black or brown scales. They are shy,
	retiring creatures unless they're provoked. Then they can be
	dangerous because they secrete a neurotoxin -- a poison that
	destroys nerve tissue -- from their salivary glands. In humans,
	their bite can result in severe pain and even death.
	    [Expedition Guide -- American Museum of Natural History]
komodo*
	The people of Komodo call this animal "ora." Elsewhere it is known
	as the Komodo Island monitor or more popularly, the Komodo dragon.
	Oras can reach 10 feet in length and weigh 300 pounds or more --
	particularly after a meal. They are the top predators in their
	habitat, feeding on wild boar, deer, water buffalo, dogs, goats,
	rats, snakes, birds, other oras, and -- once in a great while --
	humans. They hunt by ambush, hiding in the scrub brush along trails
	and in the tall grass of the savannas. Despite their lumbering
	appearance, oras can move with alarming speed when they want to,
	lunging from their hiding places and sprinting toward their
	startled victims. They can't sustain a long chase, but often all
	they need to subdue their prey is one bite. Oras carry poisonous
	bacteria in their mouths so even if they don't immediately catch
	their prey, the attack is often fatal. Using their long forked
	tongues (oras and other monitor lizards are closely related to
	snakes), they track the scent of their prey as the wounded animal
	slowly weakens from the infected bite -- a process that can take
	several days. When the victim can no longer flee, the ora moves
	in for the kill. Oras are voracious eaters. They devour every bit
	of their prey -- bones, fur, hooves -- ripping off huge chunks with
	their razor-sharp serrated teeth and swallowing the pieces whole.

glaive
	The glaive is a knife-bladed spear. It has the thrusting 
	function of the spear, and the secondary cutting function of 
	the convex blade of the knife. The weapon was rapidly enlarged 
	in the blade in order to give it a greater cutting function as 
	well as a cleaving attack. As with a spear or fauchard, however, 
	it is not overly effective at holding opponents back, nor does 
	it have the piercing or dismounting capabilities.

deep gnome
	Far beneath the surface of the earth dwell the Svirfneblin, or Deep
	Gnomes. Small parties of these demihumans roam the Underdark's mazes
	of small passageways searching for gemstones. They are said to dwell
	in great cities consisting of a closely connected series of tunnels,
	buildings, and caverns in which up to a thousand of these diminutive
	creatures live. They keep the location of these hidden cities secret
	in order to protect them from their deadly foes, the kuo-toa, Drow,
	and mind flayers.
	Svirfneblin are slightly smaller than rock gnomes, but their thin,
	wiry, gnarled frames are just as strong. Their skin is rock-colored,
	usually medium brown to brownish gray, and their eyes are gray. Male
	svirfneblin are completely bald; female deep gnomes have stringy gray
	hair. The average svirfneblin life span is 250 years.

	intruders have stumbled into it.  It is suspected that they
	may be some warped form of ghoul, but few have survived
	seeing them so information is scarce.
guisarme
	Medieval peasants discovered that their pruning hooks made 
	reasonably effective pole arms. The result: the guisarme. 
	It is furnished with a sharp cutting edge along its convex 
	side, with a reverse spike to hook. The spike can be used 
	to penetrate armor when the weapon is swung, and the curved 
	hook provides an ample means of pulling horsemen to the ground.
gunyoki
	The samurai's last meal before battle.  It was usually made
	up of cooked chestnuts, dried seaweed, and sake.
gwynharwyf
furious whirlwind
	A short, stocky elf stands ready for battle.  Her hair is
	a wild silver-white mane, and her eyes are as green as jade.
	She has a tanned complexion and clutches a pair of gleaming
	scimitars that seem to reflect every color of the rainbow.
		[ The Book of Exalted Deeds, by James Wyatt,
			Christopher Perkins, and Darrin Drader ]
hachi
	Hachi was a dog that went with his master, a professor, to
	the Shibuya train station every morning.  In the afternoon,
	when his master was to return from work Hachi would be there
	waiting.  One day his master died at the office, and did not
	return.  For over ten years Hachi returned to the station
	every afternoon to wait for his master.  When Hachi died a
	statue was erected on the station platform in his honor.  It
	is said to bring you luck if you touch his statue.
*harp
	A triangular stringed instrument, often Magic.  Even when not
	Magic, a Harp is surprisingly portable and tough and can be
	carried everywhere on the back of the Bard or Harper in all
	weathers.  A Harp seldom goes out of tune and never warps.
	Its strings break only in very rare instances, usually
	because the Harper is sulking or crossed in love.  This is
	just as well as no one seems to make or sell spare strings.
		[ The Tough Guide to Fantasyland, by Diana Wynne Jones ]

	After breakfast was over, the ogre called out: "Wife, wife,
	bring me my golden harp."  So she brought it and put it on
	the table before him.  Then he said: "Sing!" and the golden
	harp sang most beautifully.  And it went on singing till the
	ogre fell asleep, and commenced to snore like thunder.
	Then Jack lifted up the copper-lid very quietly and got down
	like a mouse and crept on hands and knees till he came to the
	table, when up he crawled, caught hold of the golden harp and
	dashed with it towards the door.  But the harp called out
	quite loud: "Master!  Master!" and the ogre woke up just in
	time to see Jack running off with his harp.
		[ Jack and the Beanstalk, from English Fairy Tales,
		  by Joseph Jacobs ]
halberd
	This form of a pole axe is seen as a convex-headed broad axe 
	in early examples, but the head is set at a convenient angle, 
	considering the point where the blade is most likely to impact 
	upon an enemy. This alone makes it quite distinct from an 
	ordinary long-hafted axe. The whole weapon reaches 8 feet in length, 
	and is nearly always topped with a long spear point and backed by 
	a spike, which was often angled or hooked slightly downward. 
	The spear point is, of course, designed to keep opponents at bay 
	and deliver a thrusting attack (this proves quite useless when 
	opposing mounted knights armed with lances). The opposing spike was 
	for penetration of heavy plate armor, with a secondary function as a 
	hook for dismounting opponents.

heart of ahriman
	The other three drew in their breath sharply, and the dark,
	powerful man who stood at the head of the sarcophagus whispered:
	"The Heart of Ahriman!"  The other lifted a quick hand
	for silence.  Somewhere a dog began howling dolefully, and a
	stealthy step padded outside the barred and bolted door. ...
	But none looked aside from the mummy case over which the man
	in the ermine-trimmed robe was now moving the great flaming
	jewel, while he muttered an incantation that was old when
	Atlantis sank.  The glare of the gem dazzled their eyes, so
	that they could not be sure what they saw; but with a
	splintering crash, the carven lid of the sarcophagus burst
	outward as if from some irresistible pressure applied from
	within and the four men, bending eagerly forward, saw the
	occupant -- a huddled, withered, wizened shape, with dried
	brown limbs like dead wood showing through moldering bandages.
	"Bring that thing back?" muttered the small dark man who
	stood on the right, with a short, sardonic laugh.  "It is
	ready to crumble at a touch.  We are fools ---"
		[ Conan The Conqueror, by Robert E. Howard ]
hell hound*
	Hell hounds are fire-breathing canines from another plane of
	existence brought here in the service of evil beings.  A hell
	hound resembles a large hound with rust-red or red-brown fur,
	and red, glowing eyes.  The markings, teeth, and tongue are
	soot black.  It stands two to three feet high at the shoulder
	and has a distinct odour of smoke and sulphur.  The baying
	sounds it makes have an eerie, hollow tone that sends a shiver
	through any who hear them.
hermes
	Messenger and herald of the Olympians.  Being required to do
	a great deal of travelling and speaking in public, he became
	the god of eloquence, travellers, merchants, and thieves.  He
	was one of the most energetic of the Greek gods, a
	Machiavellian character full of trickery and sexual vigour.
	Like other Greek gods, he is endowed with not-inconsiderable
	sexual prowess which he directs towards countryside nymphs.
	He is a god of boundaries, guardian of graves and patron deity
	of shepherds.  He is usually depicted as a handsome young
	man wearing winged golden sandals and holding a magical
	herald's staff consisting of intertwined serpents, the
	kerykeion.  He is reputedly the only being able to find his way
	to the underworld ferry of Charon and back again.  He is said
	to have invented, among other things, the lyre, Pan's Pipes,
	numbers, the alphabet, weights and measures, and sacrificing.
hezrou
	"Hezrou" is the common name for the type II demon.  It is
	among the weaker of demons, but still quite formidable.
hippocrates
	Greek physician, recognized as the father of medicine.  He
	is believed to have been born on the island of Cos, to have
	studied under his father, a physician, to have traveled for
	some time, perhaps studying in Athens, and to have then
	returned to practice, teach, and write at Cos.  The
	Hippocratic or Coan school that formed around him was of
	enormous importance in separating medicine from superstition
	and philosophic speculation, placing it on a strictly
	scientific plane based on objective observation and critical
	deductive reasoning.
		[ The Columbia Encyclopedia, Sixth Edition ]
hobbit
	Hobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more
	numerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace
	and quiet and good tilled earth:  a well-ordered and well-
	farmed countryside was their favourite haunt.  They do not
	and did not understand or like machines more complicated
	than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a handloom, although
	they were skillful with tools.  Even in ancient days they
	were, as a rule, shy of "the Big Folk", as they call us, and
	now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to find.
		[ The Fellowship of the Ring, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
hobgoblin
	Hobgoblin.  Used by the Puritans and in later times for
	wicked goblin spirits, as in Bunyan's "Hobgoblin nor foul
	friend", but its more correct use is for the friendly spirits
	of the brownie type.  In "A midsummer night's dream" a
	fairy says to Shakespeare's Puck:
		Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck,
		You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
		Are you not he?
	and obviously Puck would not wish to be called a hobgoblin
	if that was an ill-omened word.
	Hobgoblins are on the whole, good-humoured and ready to be
	helpful, but fond of practical joking, and like most of the
	fairies rather nasty people to annoy.  Boggarts hover on the
	verge of hobgoblindom.  Bogles are just over the edge.
	One Hob mentioned by Henderson, was Hob Headless who haunted
	the road between Hurworth and Neasham, but could not cross
	the little river Kent, which flowed into the Tess.  He was
	exorcised and laid under a large stone by the roadside for
	ninety-nine years and a day.  If anyone was so unwary as to
	sit on that stone, he would be unable to quit it for ever.
	The ninety-nine years is nearly up, so trouble may soon be
	heard of on the road between Hurworth and Neasham.

holy water
	"We want a word with you," said Ligur (in a tone of voice
	intended to imply that "word" was synonymous with "horrifically
	painful eternity"), and the squat demon pushed open the office
	door.
	The bucket teetered, then fell neatly on Ligur's head.
	Drop a lump of sodium in water.  Watch it flame and burn and
	spin around crazily, flaring and sputtering.  This was like
	that, just nastier.
	The demon peeled and flared and flickered.  Oily brown smoke
	oozed from it, and it screamed and it screamed and it screamed.
	Then it crumpled, folded in on itself, and what was left lay
	glistening on the burnt and blackened circle of carpet, looking
	like a handful of mashed slugs.
	"Hi," said Crowley to Hastur, who had been walking behind Ligur,
	and had unfortunately not been so much as splashed.
	There are some things that are unthinkable; there are some
	depths that not even demons would believe other demons would
	stoop to.
	". . . Holy water.  You bastard," said Hastur.  "You complete

	the effect does not last long on humans.

	Led by their supreme chairwoman Anna, the Hussy Club is an organization

	And usually, the Bang Gang is the highest bidder and one of the first
	groups to hire the hussies. Gang Scholars in particular are their
	arch-enemies and will be bullied endlessly by the hussies.
	It is said that the hussies possess a couple special abilities that
	allow them to annoy their victims. For example, they're capable of
	producing dog shit with their butts, which they will place in the path
	of their victim who will then step into it and ruin their shoes. But
	the hussies also love to wear their socks for days or even weeks
	without washing them, and will then use them as weapons by forcing the
	victim to smell the worn socks, often for a prolonged time until
	unconsciousness sets in. And finally, the hussies developed their own
	brand of perfume called "drum stint reluctance", which is very
	powerful and can cause non-hussies to be intoxicated from the scent,

	 ... imps ... little creatures of two feet high that could

	An 'imp' is an off-shoot or cutting.  Thus an 'ymp tree' was
	a grafted tree, or one grown from a cutting, not from seed.
	'Imp' properly means a small devil, an off-shoot of Satan,
	but the distinction between goblins or bogles and imps from
	hell is hard to make, and many in the Celtic countries as
	well as the English Puritans regarded all fairies as devils.
	The fairies of tradition often hover uneasily between the
	ghostly and the diabolic state.

	Several centuries ago, there existed a faction, now almost

	indeed the only power that mattered in the multiverse. Gain 
	enough knowledge of magic and skill in it and you could do 
	anything. Even challenge The Lady....
	
	According to legend, at least two members of the Wanters 
	tried just that. They died, horribly and spectacularly. 
	Legend also says that one of them almost succeeded.
	
	Then one day, they vanished. Cutters looked up one 
	morning and the Tower Sorcerous, the faction headquarters 
	of the Wanters was simply gone. Nearly all of their 
	members vanished with it, though a scant few remain to

izchak
	The shopkeeper of the lighting shop in the town level of the
	gnomish mines is a tribute to Izchak Miller, a founding member
	of the NetHack development team and a personal friend of a large
	number of us.  Izchak contributed greatly to the game, coding a
	large amount of the shopkeep logic (hence the nature of the tribute)
	as well as a good part of the alignment system, the prayer code and
	the rewrite of "hell" in the 3.1 release.  Izchak was a professor
	of Philosophy, who taught at many respected institutions, including
	MIT and Stanford, and who also worked, for a period of time, at
	Xerox PARC.  Izchak was the first "librarian" of the NetHack project,
	and was a founding member of the DevTeam, joining in 1986 while he
	was working at the University of Pennsylvania (hence our former
	mailing list address).  Until the 3.1.3 release, Izchak carefully

jabberwock
vorpal*
	"Beware the Jabberwock, my son!
	  The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!
	Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun
	  The frumious Bandersnatch!"

	He took his vorpal sword in hand;
	  Long time the manxome foe he sought --
	So rested he by the Tumtum tree,
	  And stood awhile in thought.

	And, as in uffish thought he stood,
	  The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
	Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,
	  And burbled as it came!

	One, two! One, two! And through and through
	  The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
	He left it dead, and with its head
	  He went galumphing back.

jackal
	In Asiatic folktale, jackal provides for the lion; he scares
	up game, which the lion kills and eats, and receives what is
	left as reward.  In stories from northern India he is
	sometimes termed "minister to the king," i.e. to the lion.
	From the legend that he does not kill his own food has arisen
	the legend of his cowardice.  Jackal's heart must never be
	eaten, for instance, in the belief of peoples indigenous to
	the regions where the jackal abounds. ... In Hausa Negro
	folktale Jackal plays the role of sagacious judge and is
	called "O Learned One of the Forest."  The Bushmen say that
	Jackal goes around behaving the way he does "because he is
	Jackal".

jade*
	Nothing grew among the ruins of the city.  The streets were
	broken and the walls of the houses had fallen, but there were
	no weeds flowering in the cracks and it seemed that the city
	had but recently been brought down by an earthquake.  Only
	one thing still stood intact, towering over the ruins.  It
	was a gigantic statue of white, gray and green jade - the
	statue of a naked youth with a face of almost feminine beauty
	that turned sightless eyes toward the north.
	"The eyes!" Duke Avan Astran said.  "They're gone!"

	victims which can be almost instantly fatal.
kabuto
	The kabuto is the helmet worn by the samurai.  It was
	characterized by a prominent beaked front which jutted out over
	the brow to protect the wearer's face; a feature that gives
	rise to their modern Japanese name of 'shokaku tsuki kabuto'
	(battering-ram helmet).  Their main constructional element
	was an oval plate, the shokaku bo, slightly domed for the
	head with a narrow prolongation in front that curved forwards
	and downwards where it developed a pronounced central
	fold.  Two horizontal strips encircling the head were riveted
	to this frontal strip:  the lower one, the koshimaki (hip
	wrap), formed the lower edge of the helmet bowl; the other,
	the do maki (body wrap), was set at about the level of the
	temples.  Filling the gaps between these strips and the shokaku
	bo were small plates, sometimes triangular but more commonly
	rectangular in shape.  Because the front projected so
	far from the head, the triangular gap beneath was filled by
	a small plate, the shoshaku tei ita, whose rear edge bent
	downwards into a flange that rested against the forehead.

	Ector took both his sons to the church before which the

	commanded Kay:  "Put the sword back into the steel if you
	really think the throne is yours!"  But the sword glanced
	off the steel.  "Now it is your turn", Ector said facing
	Arthur.
	The young man lifted the sword and thrust with both arms; the
	blade whizzed through the air with a flash and drilled the
	metal as if it were mere butter.  Ector and Kay dropped to
	their knees before Arthur.
	"Why, father and brother, do you bow before me?", Arthur asked
	with wonder in his voice.
	"Because now I know for sure that you are the king, not only

*kobold*
	The race of kobolds are reputed to be an artificial creation
	of a master wizard (demi-god?).  They are about 3' tall with
	a vaguely dog-like face.  They bear a violent dislike of the
	Elven race, and will go out of their way to cause trouble
	for Elves at any time.
*kop*
	The Kops are a brilliant concept.  To take a gaggle of inept
	policemen and display them over and over again in a series of
	riotously funny physical punishments plays equally well to the
	peanut gallery and the expensive box seats.  People hate cops.
	Even people who have never had anything to do with cops hate
	them.  Of course, we count on them to keep order and to protect
	us when we need protecting, and we love them on television shows
	in which they have nerves of steel and hearts of gold, but in
	the abstract, as a nation, collectively we hate them.  They are
	too much like high school principals.  We're very happy to see
	their pants fall down, and they look good to us with pie on
	their faces.  The Keystone Kops turn up--and they get punished
	for it, as they crash into each other, fall down, and suffer
	indignity after indignity.  Here is pure movie satisfaction.

	The Kops are very skillfully presented.  The comic originality
	and timing in one of their chase scenes requires imagination
	to think up, talent to execute, understanding of the medium,
	and, of course, raw courage to perform.  The Kops are madmen
	presented as incompetents, and they're madmen rushing around
	in modern machines.  What's more, the machines they were operating
	in their routines were newly invented and not yet experienced
	by the average moviegoer.  (In the early days of automobiles,
	it was reported that there were only two cars registered in all
	of Kansas City, and they ran into each other.  There is both
	poetry and philosophy in this fact, but most of all, there is

	Blind Io took up the dice-box, which was a skull whose various
	orifices had been stoppered with rubies, and with several of
	his eyes on the Lady he rolled three fives.  She smiled.  This
	was the nature of the Lady's eyes:  they were bright green,
	lacking iris or pupil, and they glowed from within.

	The room was silent as she scrabbled in her box of pieces and,
	from the very bottom, produced a couple that she set down on
	the board with two decisive clicks.  The rest of the players,
	as one God, craned forward to peer at them.

	"A wenegade wiffard and fome fort of clerk," said Offler the
	Crocodile God, hindered as usual by his tusks.  "Well,
	weally!"  With one claw he pushed a pile of bone-white tokens
	into the centre of the table.

	The Lady nodded slightly.  She picked up the dice-cup and held
	it as steady as a rock, yet all the Gods could hear the three
	cubes rattling about inside.  And then she sent them bouncing
	across the table.

		A six.  A three.  A five.

	Something was happening to the five, however.  Battered by the
	chance collision of several billion molecules, the die flipped
	onto a point, spun gently and came down a seven.  Blind Io
	picked up the cube and counted the sides.

	"Alas! child," she said, "I have nothing in the house, but I
	have spun a little cotton and will go and sell it."

	Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp
	instead.  As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it
	might fetch a higher price.  Instantly a hideous genie
	appeared, and asked what she would have.  She fainted away,

	covering himself well with his buckler, and setting his lance
	on his rest, he spurred on Rozinante, and encountered with the
	first mill that was before him, and, striking his lance into

lillend
	A lillend has the torso, arms, and head of a comely man or woman, 
	but also has broad, powerful, feathered wings and a stout 
	serpentine body from the waist downwards. Though the humanlike 
	portions of a lillend are of unremarkable hue, the feathered and 
	scaled parts of its anatomy are brightly colored and strikingly 
	patterned. Each individual has its own unique color combination 
	and is quite proud of it. A lillend wears no clothing but 
	sometimes wears jewelry. It always carries weapons and musical 
	instruments.
	
	Lillendi social status depends on a simple system of initiations 
	into mysteries and the ownership of certain totem masks. The 
	mysteries are akin to secret societies, and each mystery is a 
	specific kernel of wisdom passed on from one generation to the 
	next. The more societies a lillend is a member of, the greater 
	her status. Each society is devoted to particular musical forms, 
	songs, instruments, and weapons, so a group of lillendi usually 
	uses the same instruments, weaponry, and spells.

	The masks are tangentially related to the societies, since each 
	mask design belongs to a specific family, and long ago each 
	family lived in a single lodge and wore a single type of mask. 
	Things have gotten a little more complicated since then, but the 
	masks still roughly indicate status and family affiliations.

	ages until it was feared she might become a goddess. 
	To prevent this from happening, she was bound to Count 
	Moloch, who became the Horned King to her Great Goddess.
	She viewed him with hatred, and thought fondly of the 
	kiss of the desert wind and her throngs of adoring

	During the last Great Upheaval, while Beelzebub and his

	I have haunted the tombs of the ages,
	  I have flown on the pinions of fear,
	Where the smoke-belching Erebus rages;
	  Where the jokulls loom snow-clad and drear:
	And in realms where the sun of the desert
	  consumes what it never can cheer.
	
	I was old when the pharaohs first mounted
	  The jewel-decked throne by the Nile;
	I was old in those epochs uncounted
	  When I, and I only, was vile;
	And Man, yet untainted and happy, 
	  dwelt in bliss on the far Arctic isle.
	
	Oh, great was the sin of my spirit,
	  And great is the reach of its doom;

	  Nor can respite be found in the tomb:
	Down the infinite aeons come beating 
	  the wings of unmerciful gloom.

lug
lugh
	Lugh, or Lug, was the sun god of the Irish Celts.  One of his
	weapons was a rod-sling which worshippers sometimes saw in
	the sky as a rainbow.  As a tribal god, he was particularly
	skilled in the use of his massive, invincible spear, which
	fought on its own accord.  One of his epithets is _lamfhada_
	(of the long arm).  He was a young and apparently more
	attractive deity than Dagda, the father of the gods.  Being
	able to shapeshift, his name translates as lynx.

	In 1573, the Parliament of Dole published a decree, permitting
	the inhabitants of the Franche-Comte to pursue and kill a
	were-wolf or loup-garou, which infested that province,
	"notwithstanding the existing laws concerning the chase."
	The people were empowered to "assemble with javelins,
	halberds, pikes, arquebuses and clubs, to hunt and pursue the
	said were-wolf in all places where they could find it, and to
	take, burn, and kill it, without incurring any fine or other
	penalty."  The hunt seems to have been successful, if we may
	judge from the fact that the same tribunal in the following
	year condemned to be burned a man named Giles Garnier, who
	ran on all fours in the forest and fields and devoured little
	children, "even on Friday."  The poor lycanthrope, it appears,

	he turned back. "Tell me truly, Lord Minister. Will this
	gold you have gathered go to the one you serve?"
	
	The old man glared at the impertinence of the question,
	then seemed to think the better of it. "Yes, Viscount.
	It will go to His work. The aspects of His work which I
	see fit to place it towards."
	
	The Viscount beamed and bowed yet again. "One
	more indulgence, Gracious Father of Salvation. Could

	"No man can serve two masters. Either he will hate
	the one and love the other, or he will be enslaved to one
	and betray the other. One cannot serve both God and

	As the Lord Minister concluded the passage, the

	Medusa, one of the three Gorgons or Graeae, is the only one
	of her sisters to have assumed mortal form and inhabited the

	When Perseus was grown up Polydectes sent him to attempt the
	conquest of Medusa, a terrible monster who had laid waste the
	country.  She was once a beautiful maiden whose hair was her
	chief glory, but as she dared to vie in beauty with Minerva,
	the goddess deprived her of her charms and changed her
	beautiful ringlets into hissing serpents.  She became a cruel
	monster of so frightful an aspect that no living thing could
	behold her without being turned into stone.  All around the
	cavern where she dwelt might be seen the stony figures of men
	and animals which had chanced to catch a glimpse of her and
	had been petrified with the sight.  Perseus, favoured by
	Minerva and Mercury, the former of whom lent him her shield
	and the latter his winged shoes, approached Medusa while she
	slept and taking care not to look directly at her, but guided
	by her image reflected in the bright shield which he bore, he
	cut off her head and gave it to Minerva, who fixed it in the

	In their natural life cycle, Metroids gradually metamorphose

	slept uneasily and thought. Then it began to dawn upon me 
	that the air was heavy, and dank, and cold. I put back the 
	clothes from my face, and found, to my surprise, that all was 
	dim around. The gaslight which I had left lit for Jonathan, 
	but turned down, came only like a tiny red spark through 
	the fog, which had evidently grown thicker and poured into 
	the room. Then it occurred to me that I had shut the window 
	before I had come to bed. I would have got out to make certain 
	on the point, but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs 
	and even my will. I lay still and endured, that was all. I 
	closed my eyes, but could still see through my eyelids. (It 
	is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us, and how 
	conveniently we can imagine.) The mist grew thicker and thicker 
	and I could see now how it came in, for I could see it like 
	smoke, or with the white energy of boiling water, pouring in, 
	not through the window, but through the joinings of the door. 
	It got thicker and thicker, till it seemed as if it became 
	concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room, 
	through the top of which I could see the light of the gas shining 
	like a red eye.

	warm, light air.  According to the _Avesta_, he possesses
	10,000 eyes and ears and rides in a chariot drawn by white
	horses.  Mithra, according to Zarathustra, is concerned with
	the endless battle between light and dark forces:  he
	represents truth.  He is responsible for the keeping of oaths
	and contracts.  He is attributed with the creation of both

	could fit inside Thor's shirt.  Its only flaw is that it has
	a short handle.  The other gods judged Mjollnir the winner of
	the contest because, of all the treasures created, it alone had
	the power to protect them from the giants.  As the legends
	surrounding Mjollnir grew, it began to take on the quality of
	"vigja", or consecration.  Thor used it to consecrate births,
	weddings, and even to raise his goats from the dead.  In the
	Norse mythologies Mjollnir is considered to represent Thor's
	governance over the entire cycle of life - fertility, birth,
	destruction, and resurrection.

	liar.  How come my general invites such a shabby monk to
	dinner?  He invites the very solemn venerable I-Hsiu to our
	base for a great ceremony today, not you.  Now, get out!"

	I-Hsiu was unable to convince the soldiers that he was
	indeed the invited guest, so he returned to the temple
	and changed to a very formal solemn ceremonial robe for
	the dinner.  And as he returned to the military base, the
	soldiers observed that he was such a great Buddhist monk,
	let him in with honour.

	At the dinner, I-Hsiu sat in front of the table full of
	food but, instead of putting the food into his month, he
	picked up the food with his chopsticks and put it into
	his sleeves.  The general was curious, and whispered to
	him, "This is very embarrassing.  Do you want to take
	some food back to the temple?  I will order the cook to
	prepare some take out orders for you."  "No" replied the
	monk.  "When I came here, I was not allowed into the
	base by your soldiers until I wear this ceremonial robe.
	You do not invite me for a dinner.  You invite my robe.
	Therefore, my robe is eating the food, not me."

	stolen words which they overhear when they listen, and peep,
	and wait up above in the branches.  Their way is not our way.
	They are without leaders.  They have no remembrance.  They
	boast and chatter and pretend that they are a great people
	about to do great affairs in the jungle, but the falling of

mortai
	Mortai are a mystery of the Beastlands, enigmatic creatures
	of immense intelligence and power.  Also known as the 
	"faces in the clouds", mortai are creatures of the air. 
	They appear as great clouds spanning the horizon, covering 
	miles from side to side and towering thousands of feet in 
	the air. In fact, a basher who doesn'tknow what he's looking
	for'll walk right under a mortai wihout even realizing that 
	the creature is just drifting along a half mile or so over 
	his head. Most of the time, mortai are happy to remain 
	unnoticed, and can imitate a natural cloud perfectly. But 
	when they want a basher to know they're present, the mortai
	begin to pulsate with a golden glow, crackling with immense
	power like a lightning storm. When a mortai reveals itself
	this way, great faces of wisdom and beauty begin to appear
	on the surface of its clouds.

	face exposed excepting only his pink, peaked nose.  It was
	bright, pink, and shiny just as it had been at first.  He
	wore a dark-brown velvet jacket with a high, black, linen-

naginata
	A Japanese pole-arm, fitted with a curved single-edged blade.
	The blades ranged in length from two to four feet, mounted on

	the back edge was thinned, but not sharpened, so that the

	existent near the tang, becoming more pronounced towards the
	point.

	"With his naginata he killed five, but with the sixth it
	snapped asunder in the midst and, flinging it away, he drew
	his sword, wielding it in the zigzag style, the interlacing,

	a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned
	and tailed and bat-winged. Then a sort of cold rubbery arm 
	seized his neck and something else seized his feet, and he was 
	lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space. Another 
	minute and the stars were gone, and Carter knew that the

	and gentle eyes.  A nymph's scent is delightful, and her
	long robe glows, hemmed with golden threads and embroidered
	with rainbow hues of unearthly magnificence.  A nymph's
	demeanour is graceful and charming, her mind quick and witty.

	"Theseus felt her voice pulling him down into fathoms of
	sleep.  The song was the skeleton of his dream, and the dream
	was full of terror.  Demon girls were after him, and a bull-
	man was goring him.  Everywhere there was blood.  There was

	knew then that she had been sent to tell him of something
	dreadful that was to happen to him later.  Her song was a
	warning.  But she had brought him a new kind of joy, one that
	made him see everything differently.  The boy, who was to

	that the road to nymphs is beset by monsters."

odin
	Also called Sigtyr (god of Victory), Val-father (father of
	the slain), One-Eyed, Hanga-god (god of the hanged), Farma-
	god (god of cargoes), Hapta-god (god of prisoners), and
	Othin.  He is the prime god of the Norsemen:  god of war and
	victory, wisdom and prophecy, poetry, the dead, air and wind,
	hospitality, and magic.
	As the god of war and victory, Odin is ruler of the Valkyries,
	warrior-maidens who lived in the halls of Valhalla in Asgard,
	the hall of dead heroes where he held his court.
	These chosen ones will defend the realm of the gods against
	the Frost Giants on the final day of reckoning, Ragnarok.
	As god of the wind, Odin rides through the air on his eight-
	footed horse, Sleipnir, wielding Gungner, his spear, normally
	accompanied by his ravens, Hugin and Munin, who he would also
	use as his spies.
	As a god of hospitality, he enjoys visiting the earth in
	disguise to see how people were behaving and to see how they
	would treat him, not knowing who he was.
	Odin is usually represented as a one-eyed wise old man with a
	long white beard and a wide-brimmed hat (he gave one of his
	eyes to Mimir, the guardian of the well of wisdom in Hel, in
	exchange for a draught of knowledge).
ogre*
	Anyone who has met a gluttonous, nude, angry ogre, will not
	easily forget this encounter -- if he survives it at all.
	Both male and female ogres can easily grow as tall as three
	metres.  Build and facial expressions would remind one of a
	Neanderthal.  Its small, pointy, keen teeth are striking.
	Since ogres avoid direct sunlight, their ragged, unfurry
	skin is as white as a sheet.  They enjoy coating their body
	with lard and usually wear nothing but a loin-cloth.  An elf
	would smell its rancid stench at ten metres distance.
	Ogres are solitary creatures:  very rarely one may encounter
	a female with two or three young.  They are the only real
	carnivores among the humanoids, and its favourite meal is --
	not surprisingly -- human flesh.  They sometimes ally with
	orcs or goblins, but only when they anticipate a good meaty
	meal.

phantom fungus
	A phantom fungus is a tripedal carnivorous plant that roams the
	vast and deep underground caverns of the world. It wanders in
	search of food, using its rootlike feet to detect movement along
	the cavern floors and the sensitive tendrils surrounding its
	mouth to pinpoint prey.
	
	The maw with which a phantom fungus attacks prey is lined with
	row upon row of sharp, jagged teeth that resemble pointed rocks
	more than actual fangs. This "mouth" is not used to feed, however,
	and does not attach to a digestive tract-it is nothing more than
	a gaping natural weapon. When a phantom fungus feeds, it does so
	by squatting down on its prey and infesting the corpse with
	thousands of feeding filaments that burrow through dead flesh to
	siphon away nutrients.

orion
sirius
	Orion was the son of Neptune. He was a handsome giant and a

	walking on its surface.

	He dwelt as a hunter with Diana (Artemis), with whom he
	was a favourite, and it is even said she was about to marry
	him. Her brother was highly displeased and often chid her,
	but to no purpose. One day, observing Orion wading through
	the sea with his head just above the water, Apollo pointed
	it out to his sister and maintained that she could not hit
	that black thing on the sea. The archer-goddess discharged
	a shaft with fatal aim. The waves rolled the dead body of
	Orion to the land, and bewailing her fatal error with many

orpheus
	Orpheus is a legendary figure, described by most ancient
	sources as Thracian, and venerated throughout the ancient
	Hellenised world as a heroic, civilising benefactor to
	mankind. [...] Pindar calls Orpheus "the father of songs"
	and asserts him as a son of the Thracian king Oeagrus and
	the Muse Calliope.
	[...]
	The most famous story in which Orpheus figures is that of
	his wife Eurydice (also known as Agriope). [...] Eurydice
	fell into a nest of vipers and she suffered a fatal bite
	on her heel.  Her body was discovered by Orpheus who,
	overcome with grief, played such sad and mournful songs
	that all the nymphs and gods wept.  On their advice, Orpheus
	traveled to the underworld and by his music softened the
	hearts of Hades and Persephone (he was the only person ever
	to do so), who agreed to allow Eurydice to return with him
	to earth on one condition: he should walk in front of her
	and not look back until they both had reached the upper
	world. He set off with Eurydice following, and, in his
	anxiety, as soon as he reached the upper world, he turned to
	look at her, forgetting that both needed to be in the upper
	world, and she vanished for the second time, but now forever.

PDP-*
 		:PDP-10:
 		[Programmed Data Processor model 10] n. The machine that
 		made timesharing real. It looms large in hacker folklore because
 		of its adoption in the mid-1970s by many university computing
 		facilities and research labs,including the MIT AI Lab, Stanford,
 		and CMU.  Some aspects of the instruction set (most notably the
 		bit-field instructions) are still considered unsurpassed. The 10
 		was eventually eclipsed by the VAX machines (descendants of the
 		PDP-11) when DEC recognized that the 10 and VAX product lines were
 		competing with each other and decided to concentrate its software
 		development effort on the more profitable VAX. The machine was
 		finally dropped from DEC's line in 1983,following the failure of
 		the Jupiter Project at DEC to build a viable new model.  (Some
 		attempts by other companies to market clones came to nothing;see
 		{Foonly} and {Mars}.)  This event spelled the doom of
 		{{ITS}} and the technical cultures that had spawned the original
 		Jargon File, but by mid-1991 it had become something of a badge of
 		honorable old-timerhood among hackers to have cut one's teeth on a
 		PDP-10.  See {{TOPS-10}}, {{ITS}}, {AOS}, {BLT}, {DDT},

pelias
	Conan cried out sharply and recoiled, thrusting his companion
	back.  Before them rose the great shimmering white form of Satha,
	an ageless hate in its eyes.  Conan tensed himself for one mad
	berserker onslaught -- to thrust the glowing faggot into that
	fiendish countenance and throw his life into the ripping sword-
	stroke.  But the snake was not looking at him.  It was glaring
	over his shoulder at the man called Pelias, who stood with his
	arms folded, smiling.  And in the great, cold, yellow eyes
	slowly the hate died out in a glitter of pure fear -- the only
	time Conan ever saw such an expression in a reptile's eyes.
	With a swirling rush like the sweep of a strong wind, the great
	snake was gone.
	"What did he see to frighten him?" asked Conan, eyeing his
	companion uneasily.
	"The scaled people see what escapes the mortal eye," answered
	Pelias cryptically.  "You see my fleshy guise, he saw my naked
	soul."

pirate brother
	The Brethren or Brethren of the Coast were a loose 
	coalition of pirates and privateers commonly known as 
	buccaneers and active in the seventeenth and eighteenth
	centuries in the Atlantic Ocean, Caribbean Sea and 
	Gulf of Mexico.
	
	Based primarily on the island of Tortuga off the coast 
	of Haiti and in the city of Port Royal on the island of 
	Jamaica, the original Brethren were mostly French 
	Huguenot and British Protestants, but their ranks were 
	joined by other adventurers of various nationalities 
	including Spaniards, and even African sailors, as well 
	as escaped slaves and outlaws of various sovereigns.
	
	In keeping with their Protestant and mostly Common 
	Law heritage the Brethren were governed by codes of 
	conduct that favored legislative decision-making, 
	hierarchical command authority, individual rights, 
	and equitable division of revenues.

	Poseido(o)n, lord of the seas and father of rivers and
	fountains, was the son of Chronos and Rhea, brother of Zeus,

	waves he received by lot at the Council Meeting of the Gods,
	at which Zeus took the upper world for himself and gave
	dominion over the lower world to Hades.
	Poseidon is associated in many ways with horses and thus is
	the god of horses.  He taught men how to ride and manage the
	animal he invented and is looked upon as the originator and
	guardian deity of horse races.
	His symbol is the familiar trident or three-pronged spear
	with which he can split rocks, cause or quell storms, and
	shake the earth, a power which makes him the god of
	earthquakes as well.  Physically, he is shown as a strong and
	powerful ruler, every inch a king.

	many stones lying in what appeared to be a now dry little
	watercourse.  Bilbo was a pretty fair shot with a stone, and
	it did not take him long to find a nice smooth egg-shaped one
	that fitted his hand cosily.  As a boy he used to practise
	throwing stones at things, until rabbits and squirrels, and

	For hundreds of years, many people believed that salamanders
	were magical.  In England in the Middle Ages, people thought

sandestin
	Ildefonse left the terrace and almost immediately sounds
	of contention came from the direction of the work-room.
	Ildefonse presently returned to the terrace, followed by
	Osherl and a second sandestin using the guise of a gaunt blue
	bird-like creature, some six feet in height.

	Ildefonse spoke in scathing tones:  "Behold these two
	creatures!  They can roam the chronoplex as easily as you
	or I can walk around the table; yet neither has the wit to
	announce his presence upon arrival.  I found Osherl asleep
	in his fulgurite and Sarsem perched in the rafters."
		[...]
	"No matter," said Rhialto.  "He has brought Sarsem, and this
	was his requirement.  In the main, Osherl, you have done well!"

	"And my indenture point?"

	"Much depends upon Sarsem's testimony.  Sarsem, will you sit?"

	"In this guise, I find it more convenient to stand."

	"Then why not alter to human form and join us in comfort at
	the table?"

	"That is a good idea."  Sarsem became a naked young epicene
	in an integument of lavender scales with puffs of purple hair
	like pom-poms growing down his back.  He seated himself at
	the table but declined refreshment.  "This human semblance,
	though typical, is after all, only a guise.  If I were to put
	such things inside myself, I might well become uneasy."
		[ Rhialto the Marvellous, by Jack Vance ]
sasquatch
	The name _Sasquatch_ doesn't really become important in Canada
	until the 1930s, when it appeared in the works of J. W. Burns,
	a British Columbian writer who used a great deal of Indian
	lore in his stories.  Burn's Sasquatch was a giant Indian who
	lived in the wilderness.  He was hairy only in the sense that
	he had long hair on his head, and while this Sasquatch lived a
	wild and primitive life, he was fully human.
	Burns's character proved to be quite popular.  There was a
	Sasquatch Inn near the town of Harrison, British Columbia, and
	Harrison even had a local celebration called "Sasquatch Days."
	The celebration which had been dormant for years was revived
	as part of British Columbia's centennial, and one of the
	events was to be a Sasquatch hunt.  The hunt never took place,
	perhaps it was never supposed to, but the publicity about it
	did bring out a number of people who said they had encountered
	a Sasquatch -- not Burns's giant Indian, but the hairy apelike
	creature that we have all come to know.

	and has been passed down from generation to generation of

shark
 	As the shark moved, its dark top reflected virtually no
 	light.  The denticles on its skin muted the whoosh of its
 	movements as the shark rose, driven by the power of the
 	great tail sweeping from side to side, like a scythe.  
 	The fish exploded upward.
 	Charles Bruder felt a slight vacuum tug in the motion of
 	the sea, noted it as a passing current, the pull of a wave,
 	the tickle of undertow.  He could not have heard the faint
 	sucking rush of water not far beneath him.  He couldn't
 	have seen or heard what was hurtling from the murk at
 	astonishing speed, jaws unhinging, widening, for the
 	enormous first bite.  It was the classic attack
 	that no other creature in nature could make -- a bomb from

		[ A self-confessed heelaholic ]

	No, Amy certainly doesn't have a foot fetish, she just likes
	high heels and therefore puts dozens upon dozens of them into
	SLEX :D There is a high heels skill in the game. It is trained
	by moving around wearing high heels, and will add armor class
	and charisma while also making it harder to fumble. Very
	skilled characters will even receive a nice speed boost.

	Shoe monsters also exist; after all, female shoes aren't just
	mere objects, but self-willed sentient beings that can move
	around on their own, talk, and kick people. Hostile ones can
	be rather dangerous. Tame ones are just awesome and can also
	be ridden. And some adventurers even manage to polymorph into
	a shoe, lay eggs, and thereby obtain a couple tame shoes after
	unpolymorphing!

	SLEX divides wearable shoes into several categories: flats,
	wedge heels, block heels, cone heels and stilettos. Usually
	the item description will say which kind it is. If both the
	random appearance and the base item type are of different types
	of high heel, the one later in the above list will be used; e.g.
	if the pair is reported as both wedge heels and stilettos, the
	game will count it as stilettos. Wearing any pair of heels while
	restricted in the skill can give a nasty side effect depending
	on the type of heels, while being very skilled gives a specific
	benefit instead.

	This staff is considered sacred to all healers, as it truly
	holds the powers of life and death.  When wielded, it
	protects its user from all life draining attacks, and
	additionally gives the wielder the power of regeneration.
	When invoked it performs healing magic.
stair*
	Up he went -- very quickly at first -- then more slowly -- then
	in a little while even more slowly than that -- and finally,
	after many minutes of climbing up the endless stairway, one
	weary foot was barely able to follow the other.  Milo suddenly
	realized that with all his effort he was no closer to the top
	than when he began, and not a great deal further from the
	bottom.  But he struggled on for a while longer, until at last,
	completely exhausted, he collapsed onto one of the steps.
	"I should have known it," he mumbled, resting his tired legs
	and filling his lungs with air.  "This is just like the line
	that goes on forever, and I'll never get there."
	"You wouldn't like it much anyway," someone replied gently.
	"Infinity is a dreadfully poor place.  They can never manage to
	make ends meet."
		[ The Phantom Tollbooth, by Norton Juster ]

	Dr. Ray Stantz: Hey, where do those stairs go?
	Dr. Peter Venkman: They go up.

star vampire
	A creature from beyond the stars. Invisible, it floats along
	until it finds something to feed upon and then draws its
	life energy and blood into itself.  It is said that they
	become briefly visible just after they have eaten and that
	this is such a terrible sight it can drive a mortal insane.
*stalker
	The invisible stalker is a creature from the elemental plane of
	Air. Those encountered on the Prime Material plane have almost
	always been summoned by wizards to fulfill a specific task. 
	The true form of the invisible stalker is unknown. On the Material,
	Astral, or Ethereal planes, the invisible stalker can only be
	perceived as a shimmering air mass which looks much like the
	refraction effect caused by hot air passing in front of cold.

~statue trap
statue*
	Then at last he began to wonder why the lion was standing so
	still - for it hadn't moved one inch since he first set eyes
	on it.  Edmund now ventured a little nearer, still keeping in
	the shadow of the arch as much as he could.  He now saw from
	the way the lion was standing that it couldn't have been
	looking at him at all.  ("But supposing it turns its head?"
	thought Edmund.)  In fact it was staring at something else -
	namely a little dwarf who stood with his back to it about
	four feet away.  "Aha!" thought Edmund.  "When it springs at
	the dwarf then will be my chance to escape."  But still the
	lion never moved, nor did the dwarf.  And now at last Edmund
	remembered what the others had said about the White Witch
	turning people into stone.  Perhaps this was only a stone
	lion.  And as soon as he had thought of that he noticed that
	the lion's back and the top of its head were covered with
	snow.  Of course it must be only a statue!
		[ The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C.S. Lewis ]
sting
	There was the usual dim grey light of the forest-day about
	him when he came to his senses.  The spider lay dead beside
	him, and his sword-blade was stained black.  Somehow the
	killing of the giant spider, all alone and by himself in the
	dark without the help of the wizard or the dwarves or of
	anyone else, made a great difference to Mr. Baggins.  He felt
	a different person, and much fiercer and bolder in spite of
	an empty stomach, as he wiped his sword on the grass and put
	it back into its sheath.
	"I will give you a name," he said to it, "and I shall call
	you Sting."
		[ The Hobbit, by J.R.R. Tolkien ]
stormbringer
	There were sounds in the distance, incongruent with the 
	sounds of even this nameless, timeless sea: thin sounds, 
	agonized and terrible, for all that they remained 
	remote - yet the ship followed them, as if drawn by
	them; they grew louder-pain and despair were there, but 
	terror was predominant.
	Elric had heard such sounds echoing from his cousin Yyrkoon's
	sardonically named 'Pleasure Chambers' in the days before he 
	had fled the responsibilities of ruling all that remained of 
	the old Melnibonean Empire.  These were the voices of men 
	whose very souls were under siege; men to whom death meant 
	not mere extinction, but a continuation of existence, forever 
	in thrall to some cruel and supernatural master.  He had heard 
	men cry so when his salvation and his nemesis, his great black
	battle-blade Stormbringer, drank their souls.
		[ The Lands Beyond the World, by Michael Moorcock ]

	Without thinking, he drew Stormbringer from its sheath.
	The Black Sword began to howl and the familiar black radiance
	spilled from it.  The runes carved into its blade pulsed a vivid
	scarlet which slowly turned to a deep purple and then to black
	once more.
	The creatures were wading through the water on their
	stiltlike legs and paused when they saw the sword, glancing at
	one another.  And they were not the only ones unnerved by the
	sight, for Duke Avan and his men paled too.
	'Gods!' yelled Duke Avan.  'I know not which I prefer
	the look of - those who attack us or that which defends us!'
	'Stay well away from that sword,' Smiorgan warned.
	'It has the habit of killing more than its master chooses.'"
		[ The Sailor On the Seas of Fate, by Michael Moorcock ]

	The Pan Tangian strove to imitate Elric's irony.  
	'But you will note, Sir Demon, that we outnumber you.  
	Considerably.'
	Softly the albino spoke: 'I've noticed that fact, but I'm not 
	disturbed by it,' and he had drawn the black blade even as he
	finished speaking, for they had come at him with a rush.
	The Pan Tangian was the first to die, sliced through the
	side, his vertebrae sheared, and Stormbringer, having taken its
	first soul, began to sing.
	A Chalalite died next, leaping with stabbing javelin
	poised, on the point of the runesword, and Stormbringer murmured
	with pleasure.
	But it was not until it had sliced the head clean off a
	Filkharian pike-master that the sword began to croon and come
	fully to life, black fire flickering up and down its length, its
	strange runes glowing."

strong kanegou
	Strong is one of Takeshi's best and, as his name suggests,
	strongest guards. Nearly always paired with Kibaji,
	they form a powerful team.
		[ Takeshi's Castle Wiki ]

	He's a relatively low-level monster, meaning he can appear early,
	and he hits like a truck in melee. Fight him at range if possible.
sunflower
	A single species of plant evenly dispersed across the land, 
	from here to the infinity-horizon. Each plant had a single blossom,
	and each blossom turned to follow Louis Wu as he dropped. A 
	tremendous audience, silent and attentive.
	
	He landed and dismounted beside one of the plants. The plant stood
	a foot high on a knobbly green stalk. Its single blossom was as big
	as a large man's face. The back of that blossom was stringy, as if
	laced with veins or tendons; and the inner surface was a smooth
	concave mirror. From its center protruded a short stalk ending in
	a dark green bulb.
	
	All the flowers in sight watched him. He was bathed in the glare.
	Louis knew they were trying to kill him, and he looked up somewhat
	uneasily; but the cloud cover held.
	
	"You were right," he said, speaking into the intercom. "They're 
	Slaver sunflowers. If the cloud cover hadn't come up, we'd have
	been dead the instant we rose over the mountains."
*superman
	"FEAR ME!!!"

	Invincible supermans (sic) are terrible creatures. They look a bit
	like a ladybug, but bigger and with a mean facial expression. They're
	not cute at all. Their warcries will strike terror in the heart of
	their enemies, allowing the superman to catch the helpless victim
	and rend their flesh and bones with their super-sharp pincers.

	Tariru also did a 61-win streak in vanilla NetHack and various streaks
	in other variants including dnethack.
tengu
	The tengu was the most troublesome creature of Japanese
	legend.  Part bird and part man, with red beak for a nose
	and flashing eyes, the tengu was notorious for stirring up

thoth
	The Egyptian god of the moon and wisdom, Thoth is the patron
	deity of scribes and of knowledge, including scientific,
	medical and mathematical writing, and is said to have given
	mankind the art of hieroglyphic writing.  He is important as
	a mediator and counsellor amongst the gods and is the scribe
	of the Heliopolis Ennead pantheon.  According to mythology,
	he was born from the head of the god Seth.  He may be
	depicted in human form with the head of an ibis, wholly as an
	ibis, or as a seated baboon sometimes with its torso covered
	in feathers.  His attributes include a crown which consists
	of a crescent moon surmounted by a moon disc.
	Thoth is generally regarded as a benign deity.  He is also
	scrupulously fair and is responsible not only for entering
	in the record the souls who pass to afterlife, but of
	adjudicating in the Hall of the Two Truths.  The Pyramid
	Texts reveal a violent side of his nature by which he

	Which mists and vapours from mine eyes did shroud--

	Ever put on; a miserable crowd,
	Sick, hale, old, young, who cried before that cloud,
	"Thou art our king,
	O Death! to thee we groan."
	Those steps I clomb; the mists before me gave
	Smooth way; and I beheld the face of one
	Sleeping alone within a mossy cave,
	With her face up to heaven; that seemed to have
	Pleasing remembrance of a thought foregone;
	A lovely Beauty in a summer grave!

tin opener
	Less than thirty Cat tribes now survived, roaming the cargo
	decks on their hind legs in a desperate search for food.
	But the food had gone.
	The supplies were finished.
	Weak and ailing, they prayed at the supply hold's silver
	mountains: huge towering acres of metal rocks which, in their
	pagan way, the mutant Cats believed watched over them.
	Amid the wailing and the screeching one Cat stood up and held
	aloft the sacred icon.  The icon which had been passed down
	as holy, and one day would make its use known.
	It was a piece of V-shaped metal with a revolving handle on
	its head.
	He took down a silver rock from the silver mountain, while
	the other Cats cowered and screamed at the blasphemy.
	He placed the icon on the rim of the rock, and turned the
	handle.
	And the handle turned.
	And the rock opened.
	And inside the rock was Alphabetti spaghetti in tomato sauce.

titan
	Gaea, mother earth, arose from the Chaos and gave birth to

	and the Cyclops, were banished to the nether world.  Their
	enraged mother eventually released the youngest titan,
	Chronos (time), and encouraged him to castrate his father and
	rule in his place.  Later, he too was challenged by his own
	son, Zeus, and he and his fellow titans were ousted from

	The road from Ankh-Morpork to Chrim is high, white and

	Picturesque.  That was a new word to Rincewind the wizard
	(BMgc, Unseen University [failed]).  It was one of a number
	he had picked up since leaving the charred ruins of
	Ankh-Morpork.  Quaint was another one.  Picturesque meant --
	he decided after careful observation of the scenery that
	inspired Twoflower to use the word -- that the landscape was
	horribly precipitous.  Quaint, when used to describe the
	occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-

towel
Ravenous Bugblatter Beast Of Traal
	The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy has a few things to say
	on the subject of towels.
	A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing
	an interstellar hitchhiker can have.  Partly it has great
	practical value.  You can wrap it around you for warmth as
	you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie
	on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus
	V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep under it
	beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of
	Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down down the slow heavy
	River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand combat; wrap it
	round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze
	of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (a mind-bogglingly
	stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't
	see you - daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can
	wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of
	course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean
	enough.

*tower
	Towers (_brooding_, _dark_) stand alone in Waste Areas and

tripe
tripe ration
	If you start from scratch, cooking tripe is a long-drawn-out
	affair.  Fresh whole tripe calls for a minimum of 12 hours of
	cooking, some time-honored recipes demanding as much as 24.
	To prepare fresh tripe, trim if necessary.  Wash it thoroughly,
	soaking overnight, and blanch, for 1/2 hour in salted water.
	Wash well again, drain and cut for cooking.  When cooked, the
	texture of tripe should be like that of soft gristle.  More
	often, alas, because the heat has not been kept low enough,
	it has the consistency of wet shoe leather.

	The hairless green skin moved upon his body.  His head was a
	gash of a mouth, a yard-long nose, and two eyes which drank
	the feeble torchlight and never gave back a gleam.
	[...]
	Like a huge green spider, the troll's severed hand ran on its
	fingers.  Across the mounded floor, up onto a log with one
	taloned forefinger to hook it over the bark, down again it
	scrambled, until it found the cut wrist.  And there it grew
	fast.  The troll's smashed head seethed and knit together.

tyr
	Yet remains that one of the Aesir who is called Tyr:

	has much authority over victory in battle; it is good for
	men of valor to invoke him.  It is a proverb, that he is
	Tyr-valiant, who surpasses other men and does not waver.
	He is wise, so that it is also said, that he that is wisest
	is Tyr-prudent.  This is one token of his daring:  when the
	Aesir enticed Fenris-Wolf to take upon him the fetter Gleipnir,
	the wolf did not believe them, that they would loose him,
	until they laid Tyr's hand into his mouth as a pledge.  But
	when the Aesir would not loose him, then he bit off the hand
	at the place now called 'the wolf's joint;' and Tyr is one-

	simply to dip the tip of its horn in a muddy pool for the water
	to become pure.  Men also believed that to drink from this horn
	was a protection against all sickness, and that if the horn was
	ground to a powder it would act as an antidote to all poisons.
	Less than 200 years ago in France, the horn of a unicorn was
	used in a ceremony to test the royal food for poison.

	Although only the size of a small horse, the unicorn is a very
	fierce beast, capable of killing an elephant with a single
	thrust from its horn.  Its fleetness of foot also makes this
	solitary creature difficult to capture.  However, it can be
	tamed and captured by a maiden.  Made gentle by the sight of a
	virgin, the unicorn can be lured to lay its head in her lap, and
	in this docile mood, the maiden may secure it with a golden rope.
	[ Mythical Beasts, by Deirdre Headon (The Leprechaun Library) ]

	Martin took a small sip of beer.  "Almost ready," he said.
	"You hold your beer awfully well."
	Tlingel laughed.  "A unicorn's horn is a detoxicant.  Its
	possession is a universal remedy.  I wait until I reach the
	warm glow stage, then I use my horn to burn off any excess and
	keep me right there."

*UNIX*
 		:UNIX:: /yoo'niks/ [In the authors' words, "A weak pun on
 		Multics"] n. (also `Unix') An interactive time-sharing system
 		invented in 1969 by Ken Thompson after Bell Labs left the Multics
 		project,originally so he could play games on his scavengedPDP-7.
 		Dennis Ritchie the inventor of C,is considered a co-author of the
 		system.  The turning point in UNIX's history came when it was
 		reimplemented almost entirely in C during 1972--1974, making it the
 		first source-portable OS.  UNIX subsequently underwent mutations
 		and expansions at the hands of many different people,resulting in
 		a uniquely flexible and developer-friendly environment. By 1991,
 		UNIX had become the most widely used multiuser general-purpose
 		operating system in the world.Many people consider this the most
 		important victory yet of hackerdom over industry opposition (but
 		see {UNIX weenie} and {UNIX conspiracy} for an opposing point
 		of view).  See {Version 7}, {BSD}, {USG UNIX}.

uvuudaum
	Strange creatures with long, claw-tipped tentacles in place
	of heads, Uvuudaums hail from a far realm beyond the known
	planes. It is said that they are the lords of those realms,
	although evidence for this is thin at best. As with all
	supposed facts about that place, that claim is more likely
	a gross anthropomorphism, if not an outright falsehood.
	The merest glipse of their form drives men mad, and they 
	are capable of crushing a man's head with a single flick 
	of their headspikes. Even if the victim escapes this fate,
	their long spikes run with strange venoms.

	The Valkyries were the thirteen choosers of the slain, the

	over the sea.  They watched the progress of the battle and
	selected the heroes who were to fall fighting.  After they
	were dead, the maidens rewarded the heroes by kissing them
	and then led their souls to Valhalla, where the warriors
	lived happily in an ideal existence, drinking and eating
	without restraint and fighting over again the battles in
	which they died and in which they had won their deathless
	fame.

victorian underwear
	The Victorian woman wore an extraordinary amount of 
	underwear. The basic items consisted of chemise, drawers,

vogon lord
 		                                     [...] Billions of years ago
 		when the Vogons had first crawled out of the  sluggish  primeval
 		seas  of  Vogsphere,  and  had  lain panting  and heaving on the
 		planet's virgin shores...when the first rays of the bright young
 		Vogsol  sun had shone across them that morning, it was as if the
 		forces of evolution ad simply given up on them there  and  then,
 		had  turned aside in disgust and written them off as an ugly and
 		unfortunate mistake. They never evolved again; they should never
 		have survived.
 		[...] 
 		Meanwhile, the natural forces on the planet  Vogsphere had  been
 		working  overtime  to  make  up  for their earlier blunder. They
 		brought forth scintillating jewelled scuttling crabs, which  the
 		Vogons  ate,  smashing  their  shells  with  iron mallets;  tall
 		aspiring trees with breathtaking slenderness and colour which the
 		Vogons  cut down and burned the crab meat with; elegant gazelle-
 		like creatures with silken coats and dewy eyes which the  Vogons
 		would  catch  and  sit on. They were no use as transport because

venus
	Venus, the goddess of love and beauty, was the daughter of
	Jupiter and Dione.  Others say that Venus sprang from the
	foam of the sea.  The zephyr wafted her along the waves to
	the Isle of Cyprus, where she was received and attired by
	the Seasons, and then led to the assembly of the gods.  All
	were charmed with her beauty, and each one demanded her
	for his wife.  Jupiter gave her to Vulcan, in gratitude for
	the service he had rendered in forging thunderbolts.  So
	the most beautiful of the goddesses became the wife of the
	most ill-favoured of gods.

vlad*
	Vlad Dracula the Impaler was a 15th-Century monarch of the
	Birgau region of the Carpathian Mountains, in what is now
	Romania.  In Romanian history he is best known for two things.
	One was his skilled handling of the Ottoman Turks, which kept
	them from making further inroads into Christian Europe.  The
	other was the ruthless manner in which he ran his fiefdom.
	He dealt with perceived challengers to his rule by impaling
	them upright on wooden stakes.  Visiting dignitaries who
	failed to doff their hats had them nailed to their head.

walking disk drive
 		:walking drives: n. An occasional failure mode of magnetic-disk
 		drives back in the days when they were huge, clunky {washing
 		machine}s.  Those old {dinosaur} parts carried terrific angular
 		momentum;the combination of a misaligned spindle or worn bearings
 		and stick-slip interactions with the floor could cause them to
 		`walk' across a room, lurching alternate corners forward a couple
 		of millimeters at a time.  There is a legend about a drive that
 		walked over to the only door to the computer room and jammed it
 		shut; the staff had to cut a hole in the wall in order to get at
 		it!  Walking could also be induced by certain patterns of drive
 		access(a fast seek across the whole width of the disk,followed by
 		a slow seek in the other direction).  Some bands of old-time
 		hackers figured out how to induce disk-accessing patterns that
 		would do this to particular drive models and held disk-drive races.

wandkeeper
      Wandkeepers are well-versed in the production, maintenance, and 
      applications of magical wands. Their training and knowledge gives them 
      protection from some basic wands, including fire, cold, and lightning, as 
      well as sleep. When very experienced, they are able to break wands just 
      right to direct and enhance the flurry of magical energy that is released, 
      increasing both range and damage. The most advanced expert Wandkeepers are 
      able to completely avoid the effects of breaking.

	said.  The hunt is up!  Even if we live to see the dawn, who
	now will wish to journey south by night with the wild wolves
	on his trail?"
	"How far is Moria?" asked Boromir.
	"There was a door south-west of Caradhras, some fifteen miles
	as the crow flies, and maybe twenty as the wolf runs,"
	answered Gandalf grimly.
	"Then let us start as soon as it is light tomorrow, if we can,"
	said Boromir.  "The wolf that one hears is worse than the orc

	House, wrought all in rubies that flashed like fire in the
	sunlight.  The waters of the Trident ran red around the
	hooves of their destriers as they circled and clashed, again
	and again, until at last a crushing blow from Robert's hammer
	stove in the dragon and the chest behind it.  When Ned had
