               of the tile graphics, but uses more memory.        [TRUE]

Any Boolean option can be negated by prefixing it with a '!' or 'no'.


Compound options are written as option_name:option_value.

Compound options which can be set during the game are:

boulder       override the default boulder symbol with another default: [`]
disclose      the types of information you want offered at the end of the
              game  [ni na nv ng nc]

fruit         the name of a fruit you enjoy eating  [slime mold]
              (basically a whimsy which NetHack uses from time to time).
menustyle     user interface for selection of multiple objects:
              Traditional -- one object at a time prompting;
              Combination -- prompt for classes of interest, then menu;
              Partial     -- skip class prompt, use menu of all objects;
              Full        -- menu for classes of interest, then object menu;
              only the first letter ('T','C','P','F') matters; 'N' (None)
              is a synonym for 'T', as is boolean style negation  [Full]
packorder     a list of default symbols for kinds of objects that gives the
              order in which your pack will be displayed  [")[%?+!=/(*`0_]
              (If you specify only some kinds of items, the others from the
              default order will be appended to the end.)
pickup_burden when you pick up an item that exceeds this encumberance
              level (Unburdened, Burdened, streSsed, straiNed, overTaxed,
              or overLoaded), you will be asked if you want to continue. [S]
pickup_types  a list of default symbols for kinds of objects to autopickup
              when that option is on  [all]
runmode       controls how often the map window is updated when performing
              multi-step movement (various running modes or travel command):
              teleport -- don't update map until movement stops;
              run      -- periodically update map (interval is seven steps);
              walk     -- update map after every step;
              crawl    -- like walk, but delay after making each step.
              (This only affects screen display, not actual movement.)  [run]

              You choose a combination of top scores, scores around the top
              scores, and all of your own scores.  [!own/3 top/2 around]

              in game play or the user interface, such as notification given
              for engravings that reading is now done via 'r.'
              (e.g., use suppress_alert:0.0.7 to stop that and any other
              notifications added in that version or earlier) default: [(none)]
tileset       the name of a predefined (with TILESET=) tileset to use.  This
              option may be negated (eg., !tileset) or set to an emty value
              to disable tiles.  If the windowing port does not support the
              named tileset then a suitable alternative will be used.
              [depends on windowing port]

Compound options which may be set only on startup are:

align      Your starting alignment (align:lawful, align:neutral,
           or align:chaotic).  You may specify just the first letter.  [RANDOM]

dogname    the name of your first dog  [NONE]
dungeon    a list of symbols to be used in place of the default ones for
           drawing the dungeon.
           The symbols are subjected to a fair amount of processing, so
           that you can use C-style escapes such as \n or \081 as well as
           indicate control characters by ^x or meta characters by \Mx.
           As usual, \ can force the next character to be taken literally.
           Since many of the default symbols are overloaded, they are
           given here by name instead of symbol, with some added notes:
           stone                               (solid rock, normally ' ')

menucolor  Set colors for menus. (menucolor:"regex_string"=color)
           If boolean option ``menucolors'' is true, menus will be shown

           For example, setting ``menucolor:" blessed "=green'' shows
           all lines in a menu with the text " blessed " in green.
           The string is matched using regular expressions.
           Valid values for the color are black, red, green, brown, blue,
           magenta, cyan, gray, orange, lightgreen, yellow, lightblue,
           lightmagenta, lightcyan and white.
           You can define menucolor as many times as you wish; those
           defined later will take precedence.
           Setting menucolor has effect only if TEXTCOLOR and MENU_COLOR
           were set at compile time.  [NONE]
menu_*     create single character accelerators for menu commands.  Below
           is a list of all commands.  Each is followed by a list of window-
           ports that implement them:  'x' is X11, 't' is tty, 'g' is Gem,

role       Your starting role (e.g., role:Barbarian, role:Valk).
           Although you can specify just the first letter(s), it will
           choose only the first role it finds that matches; thus, it
           is recommended that you spell out as much of the role name
           as possible.  You can also still denote your role by
           appending it to the "name" option (e.g., name:Vic-V), but the
           "role" option will take precedence.  [RANDOM]
