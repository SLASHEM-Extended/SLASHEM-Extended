PRESS SHIFT-O TO OPEN THE OPTIONS MENU! THIS LETS YOU TURN ON THE NUMBER PAD!

I REPEAT: PRESS SHIFT-O TO OPEN THE OPTIONS MENU!
DO THAT DURING THE FIRST 50 TURNS TO BE ASKED WHETHER YOU WANT TO TURN ON
THE NUMBER PAD SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THE OPTION MANUALLY

(alternately, you can open the main menu by pressing escape and select 'g'
for game commands, which lets you switch the number pad on and off with 'n')

                With the qwertz_layout option, the y and z keys are swapped
                If the number_pad option is set, the number keys move instead.
                Depending on the platform, Shift number (on the numberpad),
                Meta number, or Alt number will invoke the YUHJKLBN commands.
                Control <dir> may or may not work when number_pad is enabled,
                depending on the platform's capabilities.
  
Important hints:
- Can't find whatever command you're looking for? Contact Amy and ask her!
  https://www.reddit.com/r/slashemextended
  Or use the #em.slashem.me IRC channel on Libera.

- Is the game looking weird, tiles being displayed as random gibberish, and
  some features or monsters aren't being shown at all? You might need to set
  the proper graphics mode. Available options are DECgraphics, IBMgraphics
  or "no graphics" (by setting both DECgraphics and IBMgraphics to false).
  Press Shift-O to open the options menu and set the desired graphics.
  If that doesn't help, your terminal emulator might be set to the wrong
  encoding. PuTTY for example seems to default to UTF-8; you need to
  manually set that to CP437 (in the PuTTY settings, go to Window ->
  Translation, and set the remote character set; this setting is likely
  named differently on other terminal emulators so you might need to
  experiment to ensure that things are displayed properly).
  Be aware that playing with incorrect settings can be highly dangerous,
  as you might get killed by monsters you couldn't see if your settings
  don't display their glyphs correctly!

- There is no "dig" command. In order to dig, equip and 'a'pply a pick-axe.

- Press s to search for secret doors and corridors.
- Press Ctrl-D (or k in number pad mode) to kick.
- Press Shift-F and then a direction to forcibly attack a location in melee.
- Press the comma key to pick up items.

- In order to look at a tile on the screen, press / and answer 'y' when asked
  whether to specify an object with the cursor. Now move the cursor around
  with the standard movement keys, and press , (comma) when on the target
  square to get a description of what is there.
  You can also use the ; (semicolon) key to directly get a cursor for looking
  at things, but then you have to use the command every time you want to look
  at a single tile; using the / command is usually more convenient.
  Remember: press the comma key when at the target location!
  Don't press Escape or Space, or you'll just cancel the command!

- Some commands, like 'e'at, allow you to target the floor. In order to do
  so, press the comma key at the prompt that asks you for the target item.
