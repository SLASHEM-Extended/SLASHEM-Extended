                                    case means the Control key, not a caret)

PRESS SHIFT-O TO OPEN THE OPTIONS MENU! THIS LETS YOU TURN ON THE NUMBER PAD!

I REPEAT: PRESS SHIFT-O TO OPEN THE OPTIONS MENU!
DO THAT DURING THE FIRST 50 TURNS TO BE ASKED WHETHER YOU WANT TO TURN ON
THE NUMBER PAD SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEARCH FOR THE OPTION MANUALLY

                With the qwertz_layout option, the y and z keys are swapped
                If the number_pad option is set, the number keys move instead.
                Depending on the platform, Shift number (on the numberpad),
                Meta number, or Alt number will invoke the YUHJKLBN commands.
                Control <dir> may or may not work when number_pad is enabled,
                depending on the platform's capabilities.
  
Important hints:
- There is no "dig" command. In order to dig, equip and 'a'pply a pick-axe.

- Press s to search for secret doors and corridors.
- Press Ctrl-D (or k in number pad mode) to kick.
- Press Shift-F and then a direction to forcibly attack a location in melee.
- Press the comma key to pick up items.

- Some commands, like 'e'at, allow you to target the floor. In order to do
  so, press the comma key at the prompt that asks you for the target item.
