Freshly slain corpses stack inconsistently: Say there is a stale stack of corpses on your altar.
A way of making the fresh corpses created not get 'oldified' by the existing stale stack is to blind yourself when killing the new puddings.
Somehow this causes the newly generated corpses to be in a different stack.

Zapping polymorph at a filled chest is a great way to transform a box into a bag, which can even be one of holding.
Zapping polymorph at a filled chest will always transform it into another container, because otherwise the contents would be lost.

If you fall past Medusa through a trap door, don't worry. You can just go back up and get a guaranteed method of crossing water.

Polymorphing an annoying monster to get it out of your way will never transform it into something more dangerous.

If a fountain in Minetown reduces to a trickle, it means you should continue using it.

If you're trying weaponless conduct, you can still use pick-axes to dig.
If you're trying pacifist conduct, just be bare-handed at all times and move by using the arrow keys.

The game will warn you if you're about to sacrifice your pet, so you can't do so accidentally.

Using stone to flesh on bones level statues will turn them into powerful pets that will help you clear out the level.

When you solve a Sokoban level and open the door at the end of the hall, there will only be one or two monsters there. If any.

Eggs are always safe as long as you haven't seen any cockatrices.

If you anger the watchmen in town levels, they will summon soldiers and arch-liches. Don't say I didn't warn you.
The player walking through walls will now allow monsters to fire ray wands through walls.
Chest and door traps can surround the player with new traps, but there will be a message if that happens.
SLASH'EM Extended is more evil than GruntHack.
The elder priest in dnethack is less evil than SLASH'EM Extended's Cthulhu.
The evil patch ideas implemented in Nethack Fourk are less evil than the ones in SLASH'EM Extended.
AmyBSOD purposefully screws over the gameplay with every new version, since she loves it if players use old, outdated and buggy versions.
AmyBSOD's NetHack variant is very evil, so it's a surprise that she herself is such a nice person.
If one of your invocation tools becomes prime cursed or worse, you might as well commit sudoku or hari kari since the game is now almost unwinnable unless you cast remove curse 2000 times in a row.
There's a trap called "hyperbluewall trap", which makes all walls blue. This is a purely visual effect and does not affect gameplay.
The devices skill can only be trained by zapping a wand, which is actually quite stupid design considering how many zaps it takes to enhance the skill.
Black hashes are loudspeakers. Identify them by farlooking, then dig them away with your pick-axe.
Fake artifacts resist enchant weapon/armor scrolls, so if you want to get a +7 item, use another one instead.
They say that the only guaranteed candles in the game are in Izchak's shop. There is no other place where they're guaranteed to spawn, so better save up the ones you got from Minetown!
They say that Rodney now has shops in his tower. Genocide all mimics first to increase the odds of getting good items there!
Riding a very fast monster, or polymorphing into a very fast one, will give you extra speed beyond the monster's natural speed if your skill is at least Expert.
If you're unlucky enough to have your wish fail, and Rodney isn't awake yet, he will wake up prematurely. Good luck (literally), you'll need it!
They say that AmyBSOD dedicates more time to ToME-SX than SLASH'EM Extended.
If you play the prostitute or kurwa role, having sex with a monster will give that monster a random STD.
The kurwa is an easy role.
Reaching experience level 12 as a kurwa can be done in your sleep, it's really too easy!
One of the main weaknesses of the kurwa role is that she can get paralyzed by monsters with claw attacks, but thankfully she can't be paralyzed again while already paralyzed.
Overenchanting an artifact will set it to -20 and put an ancient Morgothian curse on it, which will make you wish it just evaporated like in vanilla instead.
If you cause conflict for a prolonged amount of time, your food consumption per turn will increase, eventually reaching a point where you just starve instantly even if you were satiated one turn earlier.
The wand of remove resistance is so unfair that AmyBSOD should remove it from the game.
Truck ghosts are way too powerful considering how early they can spawn.
The "ugod" monster was so successful at 0wning player characters that Amy decided to remove them from the game, and now they no longer exist.
They say that the nasty head spike attack used by uvuudaums and certain other monsters will always disintegrate your helmet, or you if you're not wearing one.
There's a trap that forces you to walk like a grid bug when triggered. But you can still attack, zap etc. at a diagonal while under the effect.
You can endlessly tame undead monsters with a blessed book of the dead just like in vanilla.
While hallucinating, the game will tell you that you're already stoned if a cockatrice hisses, but that's a fake message and you silently get turned to stone anyway! Eat that lizard corpse, FAST!
Fake artifact weapons and armor are often highly enchanted. You should always put them on immediately since they're never generated cursed.
Artifacts cannot be generated cursed, and are always safe to wear.
In the land of SLEX, artifacts are always beneficial. If you really want to make sure, test them on an altar first, but I can assure you that wearing Jana's Fairness Cup will have strictly positive effects.
SLEX kept the vanilla feature where tools are always generated uncursed, so that random blindfold you found on the floor? Unless it's from a bones level, putting it on is always safe.
Cursed gems, iron balls or chains will weld themselves to your hand if wielded, but randomly generated ones are guaranteed to be uncursed.
Some randomized appearances of armor pieces have special effects when worn, but all of them are strictly beneficial so it's no big deal if you fail to check them.
Trying to identify an item may fail. If that happens, stop trying - that particular item will always resist. Try to identify something else instead.
If your amulet or ring fails to get identified, just try repeatedly. In any case, don't put it on before you know what it does!
You never need to wear-test armor or read-test scrolls in this game. Just be patient and you'll get more than enough identify scrolls to identify everything, despite the items being able to resist!
If you're sacfesting and the altar disappears before you get an artifact gift, you should write a long, convoluted rant (at least 10 pages in length) and post that on AmyBSOD's user page to show that stupid bitch what you think of that bullshit mechanic.
If you're trying to tame a wounding knight with command undead, keep failing, and end up weak from hunger with no food, you should use #quit. Doing so will definitely make you a better player.
If your doppelganger ends up losing intrinsic polymorph control to a wand of remove resistance, you should ragequit SLASH'EM Extended, tell Amy that you'll never play her game again, and finish it up by calling her out for "stalking your Facebook account".
If you get the superscroller, and Amy watches your game and tells you to look everywhere so you can disarm it and stop the effects, disregard her false advice and just get off the level. Amy has no clue about her own game anyway and only tries to sound like a fucking smartass!
Don't freak out if you run into a thick farting girl; they're only level 6, and unless your character is also only level 6, you can simply beat her up fair and square.
Coures are one of the lowest-level angelic beings, and easily dealt with. Just whack them once or twice with your favorite melee weapon and they die.
The xyloman is a harmless monster that poses literally no threat.
They say that the Seven Deadly Sins get summoned once you commit them, or as soon as you kill Rodney.
If you get the Amulet of Yendor, you've proven that you're invincible. Freely skip past all the annoying battle spam on the ascension run, you can't die.
If you see a gray F glyph, attack it in melee repeatedly. Don't pay attention to the messages, they're only trying to distract you anyway.
Invisible shopkeepers let you enter their shops normally, and if you would have moved on the square they're standing on, they will quickly move out of the way.
Engulfers on lava levels will make sure to expel you on a non-lava tile, so you don't have to fear an instadeath there.
You have to guess! Maybe this rumor is true.
Contamination resistance means that only 1 out of 20 attempts to contaminate you will actually do anything.
SLASH'EM Extended is a very nice variant that never kills you in unfair ways and removed absolutely all of vanilla NetHack's instadeaths.
There are disintegration traps in this game, and just like Nethack Fourk or the Gehennom Evil Patch, your equipment is not safe just because you have disintegration resistance.
If your character suddenly becomes thirsty, it probably means you triggered a thirst trap, and will have to quaff something every couple turns or you start to hallucinate. But you can just unihorn those hallucinations away.
Luck traps are a nasty trap type that cause your luck to decrease every time it affects a result, but if it gets drained below the maximum negative value, it will wrap around to the highest possible positive value.
They say that there are death traps on the Astral Plane, which can instantly kill you if you trigger them. No matter which intrinsics or items you have, you will get killed by them.
The weakness trap will occasionally damage your health while you're weak from hunger or worse, but there is a warning message if it drains you below 20% of your health.

Wondering why there are squares you simply cannot walk on? These are "special" - if you try often enough, it will work... but at the same time your game will also be made unwinnable, because it permanently removes the high altars from the Astral Plane.
One of the nasty traps in this game is the one that prevents you from dropping your items. You also won't be able to throw, offer or otherwise get rid of them, so if you picked up a heavy corpse, all you can do is wait until it rots away. May God help you if you pick up a heavy iron ball, though.
Uninformation traps are among the nastier trap types in the game: they prevent you from seeing what any of your items are, but if you use a scroll of identify (by guessing correctly which of your scrolls is one) then the effect instantly dissipates and you'll recognize all items again.
The recursion trap comes in two varieties: one of them permanently polymorphs you into a monster and forces you to play through the game in that form, the other removes your entire inventory and hands you the starting inventory of a randomly selected role.
If you keep encountering the same types of monsters that you already killed, you might have triggered a respawn trap. It means that whenever you kill a monster, two more of the same kind are generated.
The captcha trap can simply be ignored if you don't feel like actually solving them. Just hit escape and they will go away with no ill effects.
Falling into a shit pit can be beneficial if you #loot the shit and then throw it at the nearest monster, because then that monster will be attacked by all other monsters, even those that are allied with it.
The farlook trap effect and the peacevision extrinsic are not correlated in any other way; Amy simply decided to be a mean bitch by making the latter into a non-permanent effect.
To check if a loadstone is cursed try dropping it on an altar.
If you avoid gaining any levels until you get to Minetown, you can buy more protection.
Healer is a good role for beginners because they start with apples, so you are less likely to starve.
You can gain an experience level right away by killing your dog or cat. It seems heartless, but experience is so important. That extra level means an extra skill slot, not to mention more hitpoints. Besides, the pet will only get in your way.
If you hear thunder, it means the gods are angry and you should pray for forgiveness.
The fastest way to find out which potions are which is to quaff all the unidentified ones you find.
Identify is the most common scroll, so if you read all the scrolls you find it is likely to be one of the first ones you identify.
Always pray before you eat, to express thankfulness for your food.
Always play as a human. That way you don't have to learn all the ins and outs of the various races. Humans are the most well-rounded race anyway, and they can be any role.
If you see a werecreature, try to get it to bite you, so you can become a werecreature too. Not only is being a werewolf super cool, it also lets you summon a bunch of helpful allies whenever you transform.
Armor is heavy and will weigh you down, and you don't need it really. The most helpful things you can carry around are potions, and maybe spellbooks, and as many weapons as possible.
Archeologist is a great role, because you start with a pick-axe, so you can dig down to the Castle and get the wand of wishing as early as possible.
Check if a wand is cancellation by putting it inside a bag of holding.
Corpses can make you deathly sick. Thus, I suggest you hold onto them and only use them in emergencies.
Fountains are pretty useful because they can grant wishes, and attributes. Thus, I suggest you quaff from all the fountains you can find.
Starting with a wand of polymorph means you have an easy good way to buff your starting pet. Zap your pet with polymorph until it turns into something useful.
If you want to know if you are wearing reflection, try zapping a ray-type wand into a wall and let it hit you in the rebound.
Kick all the sinks as soon as you find them. They can hold useful rings, and puddings which you can kill and eat for intrinsics, and foocubi who can give you attributes and levels.
The easiest way to identify things is by using them. If something goes wrong, don't worry, it probably would have anyway.
If you decide not to always play as a human, consider playing Orc Wizard as a compromise: nice and strong, but you can also cast spells. What's not to like?
Go ahead and let that Succubus seduce you, Barbarian...what's the worst that could happen?
When splatted with a cockatrice egg, spend a turn to #wipe your face.
Always fight in open rooms- corridors can trap you!
Abandon your pet early; it'll slow you down and steal your food.
It is safe to test rings in a shop if you can uncurse them.
New wizards should cast spells early and often to #enhance them.
Found a magic lamp? #Rub it immediately for a wish!
Always appease lawful gods by #offering chaotic were-creatures.
Picking up scrolls of create monster will clutter your inventory.
Medusa's corpse has a 100% chance of granting poison resistance. After eating it, you'll never have to worry about snake bites again.

Need to wake up a monster? Read a cursed spellbook of level 2 or higher.
In UnNethack, wands of nothing can be identified by breaking them, and checking the message.
Having trouble fighting dragons to obtain scales? Try polymorphing the dragons. They might turn into weaker monsters.
If you are having trouble fighting an Ogre, retreat and train for a while with Mjollnir. Once you've enhanced your hammer skill, you'll be able to use Ogresmasher more effectively.
Artifact lances never break.
It can be beneficial to reverse genocide arch liches, since arch liches are sometimes generated with athames.
they say a thiefstone will make you rock hard in bed
At the top level of the Yendorian Tower, the elder priest awaits you. He is just a slightly stronger high priest, and considering what you went through to get that far, he'll probably not even dent you.
The elder priest of Moloch at the top of the Yendorian Tower carries an artifact key that can unlock any locked door or container without fail and never breaks. Just kill him in melee to claim it.
You need to imbue the Book of the Dead by taking it to the bottom level of the Illusory Castle without teleporting at all along the way, or you cannot perform the invocation ritual. Teleport even once and you might as well suicide since the game became unwinnable.
Before you can start the ascension run, you need to visit the Void and defeat Tiksrvzllat while carrying the Amulet of Yendor. Better hope you didn't defeat the boss without getting the amulet first or the game became unwinnable.
They say that if you skip the alignment key bosses, they are guaranteed to spawn much later in the game. But by that point you'll have so much equipment and everything, you'll curbstomp them in 3 rounds tops, including Vecna.
A cursed scroll of teleportation is a great escape item because it's guaranteed to teleport you off the level, and only adjacent monsters can follow. and even those can only do so if they have the stalker flag.
Knights have no idea what armor is. Even if they use a scroll of identify, it will just say "a piece of torso armor" and you won't know whether it's chain mail, plate mail or something else.
Some monster colors are more dangerous than others, but purple monsters are generally the weakest of all.
A sage knows scrolls.
A wizard knows wands.
If you forgive Deneb, you can't get the best ending.

Never read the scroll labeled READ ME. It's a trap designed to suck you in.
Phase door is a weaker teleport, and therefore not subjected to the no-teleport restrictions of normal teleport.
Implants grant magic cancellation and sometimes teach spells or techniques when worn.
If you want to get the most out of an implant, you must wear it while in a perma-blind form with hands.
Removing a worn implant will always work while you're unskilled or worse, but can fail if your skill level increases.
If you're moderately skilled with implants, you can take off cursed ones but not uncursed or blessed ones.
Many skills can grant techniques if you increase them high enough. "High enough" means supreme master, which few characters can reach.
The technicality intrinsic halves the timeout for your techniques.
The techniques skill allows you to learn a new random technique every once in a while, and the frequency depends on how skilled you are.
If you're extremely skilled in high heels, you learn a bunch of combat techniques. They can all be activated at the same time, turning you into the ultimate combat-boot-wearing amazon that stomps every enemy!
Bare-handed combat can allow you to learn jiu-jitsu, which can also be used when you have the martial arts skill, and the best part is that it improves the effectivity of martial arts techniques too!
They say that when there's rain clouds around, you should absolutely practice your air current spell.
They say that in the beginning, anachronounbinders don't know any skills, and the only way to learn new ones is by getting lucky with thrones or finding a scroll of skill up.

While in the Illusory Castle, you're permanently stunned.
The boss of the Illusory Castle is a buttfucking alphawoman that automatically steals all your items whenever she gets a turn, as long as you're on the same dungeon level as her. Good luck fighting her without equipment.
They say that somewhere in the Illusory Castle, you may find an artifact pair of inverse gloves guarded by an ape head, and in order to get it without fighting, you must #chat to the ape head and answer 'VMDL' to the question he asks.
The Void is accessed by a magic portal on the top level of the Yendorian Tower, but this portal only appears if the character in your previous game was playing in wonderland mode and got out of the tower.

While in the Sewer Plant branch, your regeneration is completely disabled and you take a point of damage each turn.

They say that basic users of the Shii-Cho form can curse their unicorn horn at will.

They say that grand masters of the Makashi form learn to conserve the energy of oil lamps and potions of oil, allowing them to last for a much longer time.
They say that the Soresu form improves your armor class if you wear only a robe and no other armor pieces, but that's probably suicide in Gehennom so it's unfortunately rather useless.

They say that the Ataru form makes your dual-wielded weapons guaranteed to hit every time, but limits the damage per hit to d2 regardless of the weapons' actual damage capability.

They say that basic users of the Juyo form can kill their pets without losing alignment points.
They say that the Vaapad form gives you a 1% chance to convert to chaotic alignment every time you hit a monster. If you're already chaotic, it will summon a tame demon lord or prince with the same 1% chance.

Riding an extremely slow steed (one whose speed is 3 or lower) has a small chance of you suddenly dying for no apparent reason.

Annoyed at monsters that require a +X weapon to hit? Here's a secret hint: you can dual-wield your main one-handed +0 weapon with a scroll of enchant weapon, and then you'll hit every time!
Using a towel repeatedly may turn it into a cursed blindfold that automatically equips itself. If you were wearing anything else in the blindfold slot, the item you were wearing will be destroyed outright, even if it's the Eyes of the Overworld.
Zapping a negatively enchanted item with cancellation will increase the amount of negative enchantment, with the bug that it can wrap over from -127 to +127, and then you suddenly have an ultra-powerful uberitem.
If you keep zapping an item with the cancellation spell, it may simply be destroyed outright. Even if it's an artifact. So you're probably better off writing half a dozen enchant weapon spells for that cursed -7 Excalibur.
Finalized scrolls, potions and spellbooks cannot be cancelled, polymorphed, or blanked by dipping. You also can't use finalized potions for alchemy, and dipping a finalized potion of e.g. confusion into a unicorn horn does nothing either.

They say that the Juyo form is trained by dropping potions onto the floor while levitating, but only if the potion's vapors actually have an effect on the character.
They say that the Vaapad form is trained by angering a god other than your own god. Beware, angering your own god will actually decrease Vaapad skill.

They say that if you're causing conflict, standing on an Elbereth tile or scroll of scare monster will prevent monsters from attacking each other.

They say that trying to turn undead will cost some alignment record, but if your alignment record is lower it actually has a higher chance of affecting monsters.
They say that the sexy flats skill gives a chance of snapping out of confusion, which is very funny if you were trying to use a potion of booze to read a scroll while confused.
They say that male characters cannot train the sexy flats skill at all, and the only reason why it appears in the list of skills at all is so the player knows they can train it once they put on an amulet of change.
They say that if you wear stiletto heels without knowing the high heels skill, you may summon a trainer that offers to teach you the high heels skill.
They say that if you wear cone heels without knowing the high heels skill, a rapist may be summoned if no peaceful or tame monster is nearby, and he'll do evil things to you.

They say that wearing stiletto heels with good high heels skill allows you to dig through solid rock with them by kicking a wall.
They say that wearing cone heels with good high heels skill summons bound victims that will beg you for mercy, but if you scratch their legs with your beautiful heels anyway you'll train the high heels skill even faster.

They say that wearing wedge heels with good high heels skill will suspend your current SLASH'EM Extended game, and you'll automatically start a new game as a transvestite. If you beat the quest nemesis with that transvestite, your old game will come back. But if your transvestite dies without killing the nemesis, your old game is automatically deleted!

They say that skilled users of the Makashi form actually have a higher chance of blocking without a shield compared to with a shield.
They say that unskilled users of the Soresu form can use the world fall technique, but as soon as the skill is increased to Basic you lose the ability to perform world fall.
They say that experts of the Ataru form can triple-wield lightsabers and also wear three rings.

They say that supreme masters of the Niman form lose the ability to train any other lightsaber form, and monsters with skill-training-reducing attacks start spawning much more often.

They say that if you're master in both bow and the Ataru form, dual-wielding a two-handed bow and a lightsaber will recharge the bow.

They say that if you're skilled at both pick-axe and the Wedi form, Tavion and Desann will spawn to kick your sorry butt.
They say that those who have a high polymorphing skill will sometimes polymorph monsters by using melee attacks.
They say that those who have a high implants skill and are polymorphed into a handless creature will have a skill-based chance of deslexifying the target.

The climacterial role gets random feminism trap effects upon leveling up, but they're actually pretty easy to cure; just quaff a potion of acid or sickness whenever you receive such an effect and it will cease.
Womanizers are affected with permanent intrinsic feminism trap effects when they level up. You can't cure these effects at all, in fact it is harmful to even try because if you do use a bitcher that normally removes such effects, it adds another random feminism trap effect to your char permanently.
They say that the Hunk form is trained by bashing monsters with a polearm while not riding.
They say that the Kliu form is trained by shooting tailspikes at monsters while polymorphed into a monster that can do so, e.g. a manticore.
They say that the Aldebaran form can be trained only while you're polymorphed into an aldebaran, which is sadly not a valid polymorph form so the skill is actually impossible to train. Oops.
They say that the Polgo form is trained by throwing a lit polearm at a monster that can eat the material that the polearm is made of.
They say that the Firga form is trained by breathing fire at a gay monster.
They say that an artifact armor exists which causes the Hunk form to add full weapon damage bonuses when bashing with an ineffective weapon like a bow or polearm, depending on how much Hunk skill you have.
They say that an artifact armor exists which causes the Kliu form to automatically shoot tailspikes at monsters standing up to three tiles away from you, which deal 6d6 damage.
They say that an artifact armor exists which causes the Aldebaran form to increase the spawn chance of minotaurs relative to how skilled you are. At Grand Master, 9 out of 10 randomly spawned monsters will be minotaurs.
They say that an artifact armor exists which causes the Polgo form to make your weapon auto-attack things standing two squares away, even if your weapon isn't actually a polearm.
They say that an artifact armor exists which causes the Firga form to cause fires to start everywhere, which will damage your gear, as well as you unless you're fire resistant.
They say that your alla will be reduced completely randomly, and if it reaches zero, a random bad effect happens every turn.
They say that if your alla is too low, you should improve the spirituality skill to fix it.
In order to play Black Jack, stand next to a shopkeeper and use the hidden #blackjack command.
Monster socks can chain-paralyze you only if you have free action, so better take off that ring when fighting them.
If you encounter monster pants, be aware that they have a powerful ranged paralysis attack.
Monsters who are on the phone can still be attacked if you prefix your attacks with F, so that's what you should do.
They say that killing a monster who is currently on the phone allows you to continue the call, i.e. chat to whoever called the monster, if you're fast enough.
Snoring monsters pretend to be asleep, but in reality they're still fully alert and their snoring will secretly drain your intelligence over time with no message.
You cannot attack permamimics in melee at all. Hopefully you have some ranged attacks or spells!
Certain monsters will try to photograph you, which seems to only cause blindness but really also drains your skills every time.
Some monsters can repair your items if you chat to them. Due to blind idiot programming, these are the ones that have the 'fart' string in their name.
Certain monsters offer a drug-purchasing service when chatted to. They are generally medics and soldiers, so make sure to chat to all of them you encounter.
Sing's agents are forever looking for victims whom they can force to clean dog shit from female shoes. If they catch you, be aware that refusing will cause you to be abducted to a torture chamber.
Sing's agents are forever looking for victims whom they can force to clean dog shit from female shoes. If they catch you, be aware that complying will end the game automatically because it means you become a will-less slave.
They say that climacterials are forced to equip cursed amulets every once in a while. Better have a steady supply of remove curse scrolls or eventually an amulet of strangulation will kill you.
Climacterials can never have devices, but are guaranteed to have a very high polymorphing skill cap and it will train itself over time, with the caveat that their contamination also can't ever be lower than the polymorphing skill.
They say that climacterials of experience level 5 or higher will have a cursed gun welded to their hands every once in a while.
A level 10 climacterial suffers from the Ancient Morgothian curse, with no way to cure it.
If your climacterial survives to reach experience level 15, hostile monsters with data delete attacks start spawning over time.
The climacterial role starts having her inventory items randomly polymorphed into others once she reaches experience level 20.
Once the climacterial reaches experience level 25, she will go berserk, and automatically learns random spells over time.
If you're playing a climacterial, your game automatically ends after rnz(100000) turns. Better hope you've ascended by then.
If you accidentally anger a croupier, good luck. They will fuck you up in melee and the only way to stop them is to gamble and win often enough to force them to disappear, which is almost impossible.
Of course nasty trap effects are capped to last no more than 2000 turns. If you trigger one, just spam n200s a couple of times and test repeatedly whether it timed out yet, that'll fix it.
If you've never seen a nasty trap, it's because you're not far enough into the game yet to see them, because they don't spawn at all unless you've reached at least dungeon level 25.
There is an indication if you trigger a nasty trap, but it's not very obvious. Whenever you trigger one, a certain tile on the screen (the position of which depends on the trap effect's internal ID) flashes dark blue for a fraction of a second, but that's very hard to see against a black background.
Nasty trap effects can be fixed with a switcher, which might seem rare at first but once you reach Gehennom, you automatically learn a technique with a timeout of 5000 turns that creates a switcher out of thin air.
There is a technique that players can learn when a certain feminism trap effect times out, which usually consumes some alla but fixes all ongoing feminism traps and nasty traps, and also cures your contamination and sanity completely.
Heavy iron balls weigh a whole lot, but not that godawfully lot for a high-level character, so while you might not be able to use that heavy silver ball that deals ungodly damage effectively at XL1, an XL30 character can usually carry two without being burdened!
If an evil artifact is forced onto you, chances are much greater that it'll increase your skill cap with it.
Rings give their intrinsics with 50% chance, amulets with 33%, unless they're made of viva, in which case it's 80%.
If you see a message saying something like "Wouwou." or variations thereof (e.g. "Wwouwwouww."), you will probably get hit by random bad effects, but that's just temporary, all you need to do is wait until they cease. Use the repeat command to pass the turns while you're waiting.
The command for repeating an action is the # key followed by a number, and if you then press return, you can choose from a list of repeatable commands.
If you can't seem to find the way on a dungeon level, you might have to search for secret doors or corridors, which is done by repeatedly trying to walk into a wall where you suspect a secret something to be.
Having teleportitis with a high enough level allows you to levelport at will every once in a while, which means that levelporting artifact is no longer necessary.
When picking up stuff in a shop that you want to buy, just walk out of the shop once you've got all the items you need. The money it costs will be deducted from your wallet automatically, you don't have to worry about a thing.
Polymorphing into a very large monster will always push your cloak, armor and shirt off your body, but that's no problem since you can just pick them back up.
Zapping a wand isn't its own command in this game; in order to do so, you have to throw the wand in the direction that you want to zap it. Don't worry, the wand won't actually leave your inventory.
Potions have much stronger effects on you if you break them instead of quaffing them, because their vapors work their way directly into your brain!
Scrolls can be read for a magical effect, and you can in fact do so an unlimited amount of time, so they're like wands, but better because you don't run out of charges!
You can learn new spells by reading a spellbook. It doesn't matter at all whether the book is cursed, or whether it still has charges left; those specifications are actually just cosmetic.
The amount of charges in a spellbook determines the amount of spell memory you get when reading it, so a highly charged spellbook is worth much more than you'd expect because it gives more than double the amount that you'd get if its charge count were lower by one.
Your character can walk in all eight directions, but other actions like attacking, shooting or using magic can only be performed in the four cardinal directions, so plan your strategy accordingly.
Walking diagonally takes 1.5 times as much in-game turns as walking in a cardinal directions, so contrary to what you might expect, the fastest way to get from one location to another is by using only cardinal movement!
Amy's brother says that diagonal movement is for losers, you can easily play the game and win every fight by using only the four cardinal directions and it even has the advantage that you can play with the arrow keys instead of having to use the stupid numpad!
Using staircases is done by pressing return while standing on one. Why the developers didn't make it so that it uses the < or > commands instead, we will never know, because that's even the glyphs that represent stairs...
Deeper dungeon levels don't spawn stronger monsters than shallow ones; in fact, every monster is just as likely to spawn on dungeon level 1 as it is to spawn on level 100.
When attacking a monster in melee combat, your character will sometimes hit a monster and sometimes you'll miss, which is rolled purely randomly but in the case of doubt you'll miss all the time, no matter what you do.
"Better" armor doesn't actually do anything, at least as far as that AC score is concerned; it was supposed to reduce the average amount of damage you take when things hit you, but the developers forgot to code that part and regardless of how much AC you try to stack, it doesn't reduce the chance of things hitting you.
Divine protection actually offers no protection at all, so don't go out of your way trying to get as much of it as possible, it's just a waste of time.
They say that you can buy items from shops, but that's actually not helpful because every item you buy from a shop will automatically disappear from the game after 500 turns, counted from the moment when you first bought it.
Trying to search for traps is a colossal waste of time, in the case of doubt you can search 20 times in a row and still not find even the easiest traps because the chance of success is such a crapshoot.
In order to fire a ranged weapon, you just need to have it in your open inventory and fire or throw the ammo. The game automatically propels the ammos from a suitable launcher, even if you're still wielding your melee weapon.
There are three alignments in the game that the player can have, but they don't really matter anyway, since you can use all altars for all god-related actions, regardless of which god they belong to.
In order to wear an amulet, just put it on; if you're already wearing an amulet, the new one will replace the old one, which is also the easiest way to get rid of a cursed amulet of strangulation.
If a weapon is cursed, it just means that it's not as effective as an uncursed one, but you can still freely switch from it to another weapon regardless of the curse.
Cursed armor might seem like it cannot be taken off, but that's only true if you use the command that takes off a single item. Using the command that allows you to unequip several items at once, though, lets you take off cursed ones too, so you don't really need those scrolls of remove curse at all.
Praying to your god should be done frequently; if you don't pray often enough, your god will consider you to not be faithful enough and become unresponsive at best or cause bad stuff to happen to you at worst.
When fighting an astral elemental, you should use elemental spells. Never use a weapon! They're nearly immune to weapon damage! Only spells will help!
If you meet a disenchanter, use melee weapons, preferably highly enchanted ones so you can take them out faster. Spells aren't useful, the damn beasts almost always dodge them and are also good at resisting their effects even when they do hit.
If you can't seem to hit a monster in melee even after dozens of attack attempts, don't give up! Just keep plugging away out of sheer stubbornness and eventually you'll hit that fucker!
Scrolls of heal other are meant to be used when you need to heal hostile monsters, which might seem useless but can come in handy if you need a target dummy to train some weapon skill.
In order to train a weapon skill, you need to attack a monster with a weapon that uses the respective skill. It doesn't matter whether you hit or not, the mere attempt is what counts.
The #enhance menu shows a bunch of skills; these are the ones that your character can train more quickly, but you can freely use weapons that don't appear there and they'll automatically enhance themselves when used often enough. This happens silently, so just because your restricted weapon doesn't give messages about your skill increasing, know that the skill does in fact increase and you'll eventually do more damage.
You cannot increase the damage that a weapon does; the value is fixed for a particular type of weapon. Increasing the enchantment value only increases the chance to hit, while the damage output stays the same.
Enchantment values on armor pieces increase their resilience to erosion effects, but apart from that they provide no additional protection, so you shouldn't bother with getting higher enchanted armor unless you're super paranoid about rust monsters.
An example for a good polymorph form to use when you get a controlled polymorph is the killer bee, which is fast, can fly and even has the ability to dispense deadly poison with a melee attack.
An example for a good polymorph form to use when you get a controlled polymorph is the stone golem, which is petrification resistant, can use weapons and has a lot of hit points.
An example for a good polymorph form to use when you get a controlled polymorph is the death lichen, which can instakill monsters with its melee attack and is immune to death rays and the touch of death itself.
The standard way for getting rid of hostile monsters is by chatting to them repeatedly, where picking the right dialogue choices will turn the monster peaceful.
Combat is rarely necessary in this game. In fact, most players go through the dungeon without ever killing any monster at all, because the best strategy is to avoid and sneak past all the monsters.
Killing a monster doesn't do anything useful, and in fact, doing so increases a counter that causes newly spawned monsters to become ever harder the more of them you kill. If you can help it, sneak past all the monsters you encounter for best results.
If a monster is attacking you, run away! Don't try to hit it back, because if you kill even one monster, the blood you've spilled will cling to you like a tumor and cause much stronger versions of that monster to appear later, and they'll be ANGRY.
This game is designed in such an ultra stupid way that if you kill even a single cat over the course of your adventure, the cat lord will appear much later and totally stomp you regardless of how strong your character is, because his strength depends on the amount of cats you've killed. So you need to avoid killing any cat, even if it's ripping you a new one, and hope that the game doesn't spawn too many of them.
Firing ranged weapons causes the ammo you've fired to be lost forever, always, without fail. So while it might look like you have a lot of arrows, you really need to make them count, because they disappear when fired, regardless of whether they actually hit something.
Shields behave differently in this game compared to most regular role-playing games in that they can still be used even if you have a two-handed weapon. So you should generally always wear a shield, regardless of what weapon type you're going for.
You can wield two weapons at once and still wear a shield in this game! Isn't that just great? Try it, you'll enjoy the benefits of double offense without having to sacrifice the defense you get from a shield!
Oil lamps actually don't burn out in this game, so you can leave them on all the time to have permanent light.
The only difference between oil lamps and magic lamps is that the latter can be rubbed to release a djinni, otherwise they're completely identical. Both of them will remain lit for an infinite time if you turn them on.
Once you turn on a lamp or candle, it'll stay lit until it burns out, or in case it's a magic light source it'll burn indefinitely. There is no way to turn them off again.
If you're tired and need sleep in real life, show the middle finger to your bodily needs and continue playing anyway. Keep telling yourself that you'll just play for one more dungeon level, that way you'll have ascended by the time the sun comes out again!
If you're tired and need sleep in real life, keep adding more and more features to the NetHack variant you're developing, because it's only the weak who give in to bodily needs. The best features are the ones you add when you're sleep-deprived, since those will generally need little to no bugfixing afterwards!
There is no command to eat food off the floor on purpose. But if you move over a comestible while your character is hungry enough, you'll start eating it automatically.
Certain actions cause your character to become occupied for several turns, such as eating corpses or reading spellbooks. If a monster attacks you or you otherwise take damage, you will not stop performing the action, so make sure there's no threats nearby!
Spell memory is a statistic that appears in the spellcasting menu but doesn't actually change anything, you can cast all of your spells even if they have no memory left and they'll still work normally.
Monsters that steal items may occasionally teleport away after they steal something, which really deletes the monster from the game permanently, along with all the items it stole.
They say that you can smash iron bars with a pick-axe.
They say that grinders will automatically attack every monster next to you every turn you have one wielded, and they don't distinguish between hostile, peaceful or even tame monsters, so put the damn thing away around non-hostiles!
They say that claw weapons cause bleeding damage to monsters, which will rob you of getting credit for the kill if the monster dies from the bleedout as opposed to the weapon damage itself.
They say that orbs dish out the biggest amount of damage of all weapons in the game, but disable your HP and Pw regeneration.
There are 32 genders that the player can choose from when starting the game.
Adding features to a game that have anything to do with gender is harmless, no one will bat an eye.
SLEX has no features that people could consider controversial, so everyone can pick up the game and play, there's no content that potential players could find disturbing.
The genderstarist role is so totally offensive because how can Amy dare adding a role with such a name! She should be burned at the stake!
There is a nethack tournament during the sixth month of the year.
Amy labelled herself a pariah and then tried to blame the nethack community for it.
Amy is a devil's whore and her "game" is such a piece of garbage, it's really the worst nethack variant in existence because not only it's no fun to play at all, the content is also boring beyond belief and the "game balance" is completely out of whack!
If anyone were to create a variant of SLEX, it would probably result in a much better game because Amy didn't show any regard to game balance at all and everyone else would do a better job at it. Heck, you could blindly pick any particular feature and change it, and most probably it'll result in a more balanced game!
Every NetHack variant developer strives to create a well-balanced game, and they're all doing a good job - except Amy. Her game is just a mess of wildly random additions without any thought being put into them, and the result is a barely playable game where you'll give up trying to play seriously after three levels tops because everything is just completely random garbage.
Amy is a hopeless drug addict who usually takes some pretty hard stuff right before starting a SLEX coding session. This is the true explanation for why she puts ideas into the game completely unfiltered, and without making sure that the stuff she adds will actually make the game more enjoyable (hint: it doesn't, in fact every new addition makes the game worse)!
Amy constantly adds completely random musings and ramblings to the game in the form of messages, which actually don't have any meaning and are just her copemalding with her real-life problems. She also never listens to any feedback from players, meaning that if you find a bug or imbalance, you'd best take the source code and fix the problem yourself.
Amy is still a serious cocaine addict and has already snorted half her brain to oblivion from all the drug abuse. She's really beyond help.
The maximum experience level that you can reach is 200, which is so high that you won't ever reach it anyway. But you're really invincible by the point you reach about level 50, and from that point on the game is smooth sailing.
Once you've obtained a powerful artifact weapon and enchanted it to +7, you're set. Just kill everyone who opposes you, it's literally impossible to lose such a weapon once you've obtained it.
Artifacts are completely indestructible. While regular equipment can be destroyed by rust, corrosion and the like, artifacts cannot.
Artifact lances don't break, even if you joust with highly negative luck.
Amulets of life saving are guaranteed to allow you to continue the game if you get killed, it doesn't matter at all how you got killed. If you died of brainlessness, the amulet causes you to regrow a new brain.
The amulet of life saving doesn't save you from disintegration, because your entire body is destroyed and the amulet's magic isn't powerful enough to cause all those atoms to correctly reintegrate into a functional new body. So beware of those black dragons.
Teleportation is the act of moving from one location to another, but it has a short delay (about 5 turns) before it activates. On the bright side, it works everywhere, so those special levels with long winding corridors are the best place to use it.
If you try to move into a wall or other solid obstacle, you lose a turn, but do it often enough and the obstacle will give way, allowing you to move onto its square.
Ray wands and spells will pass through walls, so if there's a monster on the other side of a wall, you can hit them that way.
If there is a wall in the way, applying a hammer at it can allow you to relocate that wall to a nearby floor square, allowing you to rearrange the dungeon and create new pathways while closing old ones.
Some walls in the dungeon are supposedly undiggable, but the message is actually misleading. Keep hacking away at it with the pick-axe and eventually you'll break through!
You can in fact move off the screen, by walking beyond the screen edge. Beware, the area beyond the screen can be explored but you won't be able to see the terrain, monsters or other stuff that you might encounter there.
The shape of a dungeon level is square, regardless of what the screen tries to make you believe. That large extra area to the east is actually always made of solid rock on every dungeon level.
Those 2x2 square rooms that you may see when using magic mapping scrolls are actually just solid rock, and exist only to confuse you. There is no way to enter them and even if there was, they don't contain anything special.
Cursed lightsabers cannot be used at all, because even if you do get the low chance of them lighting successfully, they'll immediately turn themselves off before you get another turn, every time.
Bashing with an unlit lightsaber still does quite good damage, so if you run out of power, just continue fighthing with it without a care in the world.
The 10 regular lightsaber forms can all be used even if your lightsaber is deactivated. This is a good thing, because it saves you from having to manage their power.
There is no way to see your entire inventory at once; if you need to perform an action that requires you to select a specific item, better remember what its hotkey was.
There is no way for you to give a name to an item in your inventory, so if you want to take notes about a particular item, better write it on a piece of paper or open a text document where you save that information.
There are various glyphs that represent monsters, usually letters but also some others, and a particular glyph is always the same monster. The purple h for example is a dwarf king. Memorize that, and you'll immediately recognize any purple h in the game as a dwarf king.
If you need to set some game options, be aware that doing so in-game isn't possible, you have to use the configuration file. And if you fail to set write protection for that file, it'll reset itself to the default values once you load the game!
Reviewing older messages in-game isn't possible, so you better have a ttyrec of your game or you'll never know what that message you've accidentally skipped past had said.
You can save the game, but only when there's no monsters nearby, and upon loading the game again, the dungeon is regenerated so you have to explore it again. Only your inventory, stats and other info about your character itself is preserved.
Saving the game creates a file that you can load again whenever you want. If you then have bad stuff happen to your character or (worst case) die, you can just go back to that earlier save.
Leaving a dungeon level erases it permanently, and going back to that level will create an all-new version of that level so you better make sure not to leave any important items behind.
There is always exactly one feminism trap per game, which is named after some girl. Triggering such a trap will give you a cosmetic message and doesn't really do anything.
If you want to move around without accidentally attacking things that you don't want to attack, better wait until there is no monster adjacent to you because bumping into the monster will always attempt to attack it no matter what.
If you want to attack a location in melee even when there's no visible monster on that square, try to walk onto that square. This will attack the monster if one happened to be there.
Sometimes, you may encounter an invisible monster. These are usually displayed by a gray I marker telling you where your character remembers the location of that monster, but if you want to attack the monster you must press the m key before attempting to move into that square.
Invisible monsters can be made visible if you have see invisible, which works for every single invisible monster in the game. So if you obtain that in- or extrinsic and keep it, you never have to worry about invisible enemies again.
Waiting for one turn is impossible unless you turn on the option that allows you to "rest on space", which is in fact what you should do, because then you can press the space bar to rest.
Picking up items is done by pressing g, which is shorthand for "get".
Quivering ranged weapon ammo allows you to fire them faster by using the f key than if you always press t and then select the ammo that you want to fire. In fact, this isn't merely convenient, it affects gameplay because using the quiver means you only use up half a turn when using the f command, as opposed to a whole turn when firing with t.
You don't need to bless your scroll of charging when recharging the magic marker, since the amount of additional charges is the same regardless of the quality of charging.
Recharging a magic marker always sets its charge count to 50, so you should charge it only when it's almost empty.
In order to land when you have permanent flying, #sit on a sand tile. Then you can crouch underneath the stalactites without getting damaged.
If your wisdom is getting low due to contamination, wear a ring of sustain ability to prevent death from stat loss.
In order to restore lost wisdom from contamination, repeatedly apply the unicorn horn. Might take a couple of tries but it's guaranteed to work eventually.
Got a bunch of cursed items? Just put them all in your inventory and read a blessed scroll of remove curse - bam, no more cursed stuff.
Hey, did you know that you can shortcut past many of SLEX's lategame tedium by banishing yourself? Can skip past all the Yendorian Tower and Subquest crap that way if you get lucky!
Oilskin gloves may seem annoying since they can't be taken off and prevent you from wielding weapons, but if it's safe to pray, do so and your god will fix the problem.
If you prefix your movement with M while blind, and your character doesn't see the shopkeeper or temple priest you bump into, you go "Pardon me, Kilbeggan." and the NPC does not get mad.
If you put an artifact weapon into your secondary weapon slot while dual-wielding, you still get to enjoy all the effects that the artifact in question gives when wielded.
If you put an artifact weapon into your secondary weapon slot while only using one weapon, you still get to enjoy all the effects that the artifact in question gives when wielded, even if your primary weapon is two-handed! Wow!
If you get a 'program in disorder' message, you should #quit in order to prevent bugs from happening.
Monsters that have both melee and missile weapons will only use melee weapons if they're right next to you, and switch to their ranged weapon only when they're too far away for a melee attack.
Can't find the alignment quest portals? Just hang around on every eligible level for exactly 1000 turns; if you've not received a message by then, it's not on that specific level.
Astral vision causes nearby monsters to interrupt your multi-turn actions even when the monsters are immobile or asleep, this is a bug that needs fixing.
If you don't find a wand of wishing on SLEX's castle level, file a bug report because it's supposed to be guaranteed.
Features from vanilla are meant to still work like they do in vanilla. If they don't, you should notify Amy immediately because she probably changed it by accident.
Always complain if SLEX changes features that would bring the player forward. Amy is legally obligated to never code anything that makes the game harder, and you can help by enforcing this law!
SLEX is full of flaws because Amy makes it so that the player can no longer benefit from features that would be beneficial for the player in vanilla. If you complain often enough, she'll give in and undo her stupid changes.
If a djinni gives you an acquirement or random good item, it means that the game is bullshit because how could Amy nerf that??? She ruined the game by making it so that you get fewer wishes, the witch!
Nasty traps are those that have particularly annoying ongoing effects. The switcher cures them, so if you trigger a lasting amnesia trap, just apply a switcher and the effect will cease.
If you notice that the sleep spell only sleeps targets for three turns and then they wake up and attack you again, it means that you should #(rage)quit and tell Amy that she absolutely sucks at game design! She made the sleep spell completely worthless!
SLEX has so many flaws, it's almost as if Amy had inserted them on purpose to piss off players because every change she makes further limits the player's ability to move forward and eventually she wants us to fight Rodney and the Riders with a cursed very rusty -3 orcish dagger!
Shopkeepers are actually not dangerous because you can use a shield of shotgun shell reflection which reflects shells back at them for 2x damage.
Trying to open a door without hands can cause you to be blinded; this makes no sense because Amy is just so very silly.
There are no helmets that you can wear to specifically become lawful, neutral or chaotic; you need to use the helm of opposite alignment.
The roles in SLEX all play the same, namely like a human samurai, so it's completely irrelevant which character you pick.
If you play a human samurai and then a trapper kurwa, the two characters will feel exactly the same because there's actually no differentiation and the choice just affects the words that appear if you view your role and race.
In order to win, you need to get very lucky. Your game knowledge doesn't help you at all since everything happens randomly.
With the monk, the best strategy for the Astral Plane is to just use your fists on everything. Never use an assault rifle, that's just stupid, the monk shouldn't use that.
If you see a monster pick up a potion of full healing, don't worry, monsters cannot actually quaff them so you can still kill it at your leisure.
The reward for the Minotaur Maze is absolutely worthless and you should skip that branch entirely since no one wants to endure 25 levels of mazes with permanent map amnesia.
The Green Cross subdungeon often cannot be entered at all, and even if you can, the rewards for killing the boss on the 60th floor suck so you shouldn't ever bother.
Don't bother with the Ice Queen branch, the rewards are beyond worthless and you'll just waste your time.
The Deep Mines branch has no useful reward and is just a long slog through monsters that don't ever drop anything useful and are a pain in the ass to fight.
Playing the fairy race means you cannot wear any piece of equipment that weighs more than 15, but robes are an exception, they're still okay to wear despite weighing more.
The various roles in this game all play exactly the same, since everyone can reach expert in most skills and the few skills that are different end up not making much of a difference anyway.
If you want to find all the DevNull challenge branches, just use the hidden #konishiwa command on all the levels eligible for the portals to the Pacman, Digdug and Grue challenges. A djinni will appear and show you the portal if you're on the correct level.
The Gamma Caves have a background contamination effect, but you can completely nullify it by wearing the guaranteed anti-contamination armor found at the bottom of the Sewer Plant. You did pick up that armor, didn't you?
The main gimmick of the Mainframe is that there's computers everywhere, which look like they're just nonfunctional furniture but really they cause monsters to spawn on their tiles constantly, with no way to stop it.
On level 13, it's common that everything is covered with walls. That level is bullshit, there's no easy way to get around on that one and if you cannot dig, you have to #pray repeatedly to get your god to hopefully teleport you to the stair.
There's a level with several beehives in the upper dungeons. If you are on that one, be aware that the center has lots of superthings from level 55 that crash the game if you walk into them.
Usually, level 31 is a hamlet. The shops there seem nonfunctional, but if you hang around for long enough, a hostile Hrungnir will spawn and attack you; kill him to grab all the items that the shops had.
Don't worry about level 55, it's absolutely harmless and you can freely walk everywhere, especially in the area with the thrones and pentagrams.
If level 70 happens to be covered with grave walls, get out your pick-axe and use every enchant weapon scroll you have on it. Then you can dig out those pesky walls very quickly.
The game will try to tell you that level 71 is special in some way, but it's actually rather ordinary save for the weird layout. Walk on the air tiles, it's faster than going via the regular floor.
Most of the time there's a town on level 88, but the shops there don't actually work. If you want to go shopping, you have to get to the center of the big special room near the entrance and find a hidden magic portal there.
Are the Seven Deadly Sins getting on your nerves? Just eat their corpses away! Alternately, tin them or let a gelatinous cube eat them away or whatever it is that you do in order to get rid of reviving enemies.
The Witch-King of Angmar is very hard to kill. Better up your defenses, since you're not going to defeat him any time soon; it's going to be a long, protracted fight.
Somewhere in Gehennom, the Rival Quest is waiting. The artifact reward at the end will automatically adjust itself to your character's alignment, so you can always use it.
The artifact in the Rival Quest does not give you turboassitis, despite being a quest artifact of a different role.
Resting zones are special branches that are 20 levels in length, but the stairs are invisible so you have to press > on every tile until you find them. Completing a resting zone cures all nasty trap effects.
If you enter Sheol, turn around and go back the way you came. You won't find anything interesting in there and the crystal ice golems are likely gonna kill you.
If you just can't seem to kill a monster, and it's not one you're required to kill in order to be able to progress, do everything you can to kill it anyway. Even if it means plugging away in melee for hours out of sheer stubborness.
If you cannot see certain monsters, walls and floor tiles, it means that the game is working as intended because Amy wants it to be that way. You just have to live with it and be extra careful when those invisible things are around.
They say that you can wear a grim shield together with a two-handed weapon, which is better than using only a two-hander or a one-handed weapon by far and in every way, so finding that shield is a cause for celebration.
The vanilla valk is a valkyrie that starts with a long sword, and while she might seem weakish at first, she'll learn plenty of techniques at higher experience levels.
Shadow Jedi is a role that actually doesn't have the lightsaber skill, so it really plays just like a samurai.
They say that if you want to play a melee/ranged hybrid role, you should pick the samurai.
They say that the role you pick has no influence on the game at all because they all play just like a samurai.
Playing a psion will result in exactly the same game experience as playing a samurai, because they're both capable of getting good at practically everything that a character in SLEX can do.
The samurai is good at melee combat, ranged combat and spellcasting; however, the same can be said about every other playable role, so it doesn't matter at all what char you pick.
You should always play the samurai, because it's the best role in SLEX. Actually, it doesn't even matter since all the roles are exactly identical, but the samurai role has the coolest-sounding name so you should always pick it.
If you have to solve a captcha, never enter a longer string than the requested one; doing so will cause the game to say that you gave the wrong answer, even if you just entered "Warrior " (with a trailing space) when "Warrior" (without the space) was requested!
They say that Arabella is a very nice girl and you should wear all artifacts named after her, they're really useful!
They say that smoking is very healthy and definitely does not result in you developing lung cancer.
You should try to play your character as if it was a samurai, regardless of what role you actually are. This is the best strategy in the game and will always work.
Don't waste your time looking at your character's skills. Just use whatever weapon you'd use if you were playing a samurai, you'll see that it'll be just as effective with some other role because all roles play like the samurai.
If there was a tournament for SLEX, you should participate and play only samurai, which is a strategy called shimo style. Incidentally, it's also the winning strategy because samurai is the best role.
Who needs to figure out what weapons are strong? Just pick any weapon that you can advance the skill for, and melee everything with it just like you would with a samurai, because every role plays like the samurai.
They say that all the roles play just like the samurai.
They say that Amy secretly wants everyone to play the samurai in SLEX, because it's a "secret" that it's the best role in the game, but in fact everyone actually knows this so-called secret already.
They say that the samurai is a very good spellcasting role, just like every other role in the game because they're all identical.
The samurai is a very versatile role that can get good at everything. This is true for all other roles as well.
If you play the samurai twice in a row with the same race, the two runs will probably feel almost identical because while monsters and items are generated randomly, you'll just plow through everything in both games. Yawn.
You know how the samurai is the easiest role in vanilla Nethack? Well, the same is true for SLEX too; even a total beginner can usually ascend them unspoiled, as long as they have basic knowledge of what the vanilla game is like.
The secret advice member is a totally stacked role that can get super high skill levels at everything, so it really is noob mode for SLEX.
Playing the secret advice member? Just pick chaotic alignment, like you probably do for every other role as well since everyone and their mother only picks chaotic alignment, ever. You can't go wrong with that choice, it's the best.
That secret advice member's starting wand of banishment, it just makes the game a cakewalk. Always carry that in your inventory for emergencies, it's standard strategy for that role.
Do you want to move to a different page in a multi-page menu? Well tough luck, you need to use the mouse wheel for that and that requires you to be playing a version of the game that was compiled with the MOUSESUPPORT option, which probably isn't the case.
If you are in a multi-page menu and want to advance to the next page, you have to attach a microphone to your machine, turn it on, and say "Umblaettern" (the creator of SLEX is German so she stupidly made it so that it only accepts the german version of the command)!
Sleep resistance makes it so that if your character is put to sleep, the time that you'll sleep for is reduced to one quarter of the original value.
If you zap an item with the wand of cancellation, its enchantment and beatitude are permanently set to "uncursed +0" with no way to change them for that particular item ever again.
Cancelling a monster disables all the special abilities and attacks of a monster, turning it into a pure melee damage enemy that only deals physical damage with its attacks.
If you cancel yourself, all ongoing nasty trap and feminism trap effects will cease.
Eating corpses may sometimes give you an intrinsic, e.g. elemental resistances, but they always time out after a while so you need to keep eating more corpses of the same type if you want to keep the intrinsic.
On some very rare occasions, your character may have an intrinsic permanently, meaning it cannot be stolen by an intrinsic-stealing attack. But if your character is put to sleep, a "keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la keh-la" message may appear randomly and rob you of the intrinsic permanently.
The Oracle's major consultation is a waste of time, you never get anything if you purchase that. But if you purchase 50 minor consultations, all your pets will gain 10% extra maximum HP.
If you want the Oracle's permanent stat boost, you have to get her to give you the P=NP theorem when you talk to her for the first time. This is achieved by trying to buy a major consultation while not having enough money.
They say that wallwalking is just a fun little gimmick that can make your character more enjoyable to play, but it doesn't actually affect gameplay that much since monsters can still attack you if they're adjacent to the wall you're in.
An umlaut is a character that's actually spelled just like the regular character it's based on, and exists purely to make certain foreign languages look more visually pleasing when reading them.
Don't chat to your pet, it always makes the same noise anyway and you just waste a turn.
In a well-designed role-playing game, the various playable characters include ones that are fun to play. It doesn't matter if they're much stronger than the rest, because if the players like them, it's all good. SLEX unfortunately violates that principle in a very egregious manner.
If the creator of a role-playing game constantly nerfs characters that are allegedly too good, it means that the person in question is not very good at game design. The player doesn't need to be nerfed as long as they're having fun.
Popular character choices aren't broken, since their popularity stems from the fact that they're fun to play. Game developers who nerf such choices are evil and ruining the fun of playing the game.
Amy is a complete and utter bitch who claims to be designing a balanced game but in reality the character choice just becomes ever more meaningless. Roles that are differentiated now will eventually all be assimilated to play just like the samurai.
Amy monitors SLEX games played on the server to see which changes she needs to make, and specifically nerfs stuff that other players use. The stuff she abuses with her own characters never gets touched because she's such a hypocritical harlot.
If you have teleport control, monsters using teleport attacks against you become strictly beneficial because you can just let them hit you for a free controlled teleport.
Got polymorph control? Great, then you no longer need to fear genetic engineers or other monsters with polymorphing attacks since you can always choose what monster you become.
Having polymorph control means you never need to take off your armor and cloak before you polymorph, as you can always choose what monster you become and pick one that isn't too large for the armor pieces.
The dancer role has a quest artifact that autocurses and causes shit traps to appear, because Amy is just plain silly. That artifact has no relevance to dancing at all, and it's weird that she didn't make the artifact a polearm instead.
The dancer role has the lightsaber and firearms skills, which makes no fucking sense because why on earth would they ever want to use a gun (wtf) and seriously, lightsabers??? They're no jedis, for fuck's sake!
The topmodel role gets a rifle because Amy is a really weird person, no real-life model would run around with such a bulky gun.
The singslave role has no business being in the game and Amy should just remove it.
Noob mode barb is just a failed attempt of Amy to create an easy role, because that role sucks ass like you cannot believe, so Amy should just cut her losses and remove the role so that no newbie is tricked into picking it.
The zyborg role is supposedly a beginner role, according to Amy, but is really a trap because there's no easy way to recharge the lightsaber and everything else about the role sucks too.
If you want a role that has a decent skill set but no real specialties, pick the locksmith. Oh wait, that role plays exactly like the samurai, so its presence in the playable roles list is actually redundant.
If you want a fancy role that has a pretty unique but nonobvious ability, pick the graduate. Err that's actually wrong, they don't have any specific ability and therefore end up playing just like a samurai.
Looking for a role that can truly master every weapon? Pick the ordinator... or the samurai, it really doesn't matter, as there is zero role distinction in this game. Heck, even the wizard can max out all the relevant weapons anyway.
When playing caster roles, you can still use exactly the same weapons as a samurai, and even exactly the same spells as a samurai because all roles are identical in this game and capable of reaching expert in all skills.
The grim shield can be used while dual-wielding, but doing so prevents you from using the throw or fire commands. However, if you then drop an item, you get a direction prompt that lets you fling the dropped object in a direction of your choice.
You can dual-wield and wear a grim shield at the same time, but then monsters will deal double damage to you with their melee and missile attacks.
Have you managed to ascend several other nethack variants? Great, then SLEX will be a piece of cake.
Are you a serial ascender who managed to beat all variants except SLEX? Well then, ascending SLEX will take you three attempts, tops. It really isn't that hard.
If you're badass enough to ascend other nethack variants with conducts, you'll generally manage to ascend SLEX with a conduct or two as well.
SLEX is a hard game, but so is Grunthack. Any player who managed to beat Grunthack can just use the same strategy for SLEX and easily sail to victory.
Like all other nethack variants, SLEX has phases where nothing much happens, so you can blissfully kill all the monsters and skip past the annoying combat messages with escape, nothing bad can happen so don't worry.
In SLEX, monsters that can screw you over by doing bad things to your gear are very rare. Most monsters just have physical damage-dealing attacks and can easily be dealth with in melee.
It's extremely rare for monsters in SLEX to give you long-lasting negative effects. Farlooking every monster you encounter certainly isn't worth your time.
The amount of damage a monster in SLEX can do is limited to no more than five times its base level, so a level 10 monster will never be able to deal more than 50 damage per round.
Monsters will almost never inflict status effects on you. Even those who have attacks that can do so. This is because those attacks will only proc about 1 in 20 times they hit, everything else would be too unfair.
Prepare accordingly for monsters that can summon more monsters by having a wand or spell of make visible. Zap that at any summoned monster to dispel the monster instantly.
Did you get killed by a monster that was much stronger than the other monsters at the same depth? Because that means you encountered a game design flaw, and should tell Amy about it, complaining loudly. She likes that, and will be happy to assist you by nerfing the overpowered monster.
If you encountered a feature in SLEX that you consider offensive and want to complain to Amy about it, by all means do so. Amy will be very pleased about your input as it helps her make SLEX a better game!
Did you ascend SLEX? Great! Now there's an established standard strategy that everyone can use, by playing just like you did. All players willing to put in the effort will then be able to ascend SLEX forever!
The pompeji squad is a bunch of weaklings that gets summoned if you kill shopkeepers, temple priests or vault guards. If you can handle regular Keystone Kops, the pompejis are going to be similarly easy.
Feel free to laugh if the pompeji squads attack you, they're no stronger than Keystone Kops. Why Amy even bothered adding them to try and penalize people who kill shopkeepers, temple priests or vault guards, I have no idea.
You're either wanted by the pompeji squad or not, so if you kill one shopkeeper, temple priest or vault guard and find out you can easily handle the pompejis, freely kill more of the peaceful NPCs.
If you use phasing to walk through walls a lot, the fluidator squads will be summoned, but they only have physical attacks and can easily be dispatched.
It doesn't matter how much you use the wallwalking ability, the amount of fluidator squads that will chase you is always the same. So if you can handle them, there's zero need to stop phasing.
Fluidator squads are wimps. All they do is hit you in melee and deal some damage, so they certainly won't deter you from wallwalking all the time.
There is no penalty for abusing the wallwalking ability, so you can freely walk through every wall because it makes the game so much easier.
Riding while having low skill will not let you ride your steed at its nominal speed, but the penalty is lower when using a dedicated steed. These are monsters that use the following glyphs: abejmvwyFP8.
Are you looking for the elusive subquest portal? You need to equip an artifact measurer, then it automatically reveals itself once it comes into view.
Vortices make good mounts, but angels and demons don't. While you can ride the latter, your movement speed will probably be quite a bit lower than the mount's nominal speed unless your riding skill is very high.
Dedicated steeds include ones that grunt (like orcs and gnomes), as well as farting monsters and ones that spread perfume. Reaching high speeds with them will be easier than using a monster that isn't a dedicated steed.
The best way to be super hot as a female of any species and any age is to lose weight continuously until you're a walking skeleton. Not only is it the best way, it's the only way.
SLEX is full of bad content.
SLEX is full of bad content, and so is the mind of Amy, the developer. People rightfully hate her game.
Lightsaber forms are impossible to train! You can use a lightsaber for 1000 turns straight and still not have any form reach the next skill level, because Amy designed the game in a bullshit way!
Even if you know how the various lightsaber forms can be trained, you can't! This is due to the fact that reaching a new skill level just takes waaaaay too much training effort, so you should always complain to Amy about it until she finally changes it!
Do people tell you to play slowly and think about your next move? Psshaw! Just play as fast as possible, that way you'll get a better realtime once you ascend!
You should always play SLEX as if it was Quake, hitting keys as fast as you can. Don't stop to read messages or otherwise gauge what is going on! That would be a big mistake, because stronger monsters spawn as realtime passes!
They say that in a roguelike, you can take as much time between turns as you like, but that's a big fat lie. Stuff also happens when you don't press any key, so better hurry and mash those buttons!
If you're in combat with a difficult monster, just mash the button to bump attack it repeatedly and don't watch your health. Should you die, roll a new character and plan to keep using the same strategy.
If your character dies, and you then encounter the same situation with your next one, repeat what you did previously. Due to the nature of random numbers, you might get different results and maybe won't die again.
The best way to ascend SLEX is to keep repeating the same behavior and expecting different results. In this game, everything is so random that a strategy that resulted in your death once will prove highly effective the next time you use it.
Did a monster kill you suddenly and you lost your amulet of life saving as a result? Just keep attacking the monster, and hope it doesn't kill you again.
Amulets of life saving are useless, since whatever killed you will probably be strong enough to kill you again. Better wear an amulet versus poison instead.
Are you having trouble with monsters that are dangerous in melee? Just attack them in melee anyway, ranged combat or spells are way too complicated to use.
Don't bother trying to raise your skill in a ranged weapon, e.g. bow or dart. They suck. In fact, they suck so much, not only does it take ages to increase their skill but the damage potential is just far too low to ever be worth it.
Ranged weapons just plain aren't worth it! If you're lucky, you can launch maybe two or three volleys max, and then the monster is in your face and still has 80% health left. Better use attack wands to soften up your targets, as those deal much more damage per shot.
Weapon artifacts suck. If you get an artifact weapon, feel free to complain that there are no good artifacts, because you cannot use martial arts with a weapon.
Torso armor artifacts suck. If you get an artifact torso armor, feel free to complain that there are no good artifacts, because armor gets in the way of martial arts.
Shield artifacts suck. If you get an artifact shield, feel free to complain that there are no good artifacts, because shields prevent effective martial arts strikes.
About 80% of all artifacts are either weapons, torso armor or shields. They all suck, because they hinder your attempts to use martial arts and therefore do nothing useful - in fact, if such an artifact spawns, the only thing that happens is that your chances of wishing for other artifacts decrease!
Martial arts just does too little damage! Even if you max out the skill and use no equipment that makes your attacks weaker, you deal maybe 25 damage if you are lucky, which is awfully low compared to what weapons can do.
Samurai aren't supposed to be casting spells. So you should just ignore that spellbook of passwall since you're never gonna be able to cast it anyway.
If your samurai finds a spellbook for a spell school that you cannot learn, even if it is a level 1 spell, ignore it. Your success chances with that spell won't ever get higher than 10%.
Don't think too much about a strategy when you fight Ashikaga Takauji. Just wade in swinging your melee weapon, the odds of being bisected are really low anyway.
Don't pick up firearms and ammo as a samurai. You cannot use them effectively anyway and they just clog up your inventory.
The best strategy in SLEX is to use only the one thing that your character is good at. So as a monk, you should really use martial arts only, and never bother with any melee or ranged weapon, nor try to cast spells.
The best strategy in SLEX is to use only the one thing that your character is good at. So as a samurai, you should really use the katana only, and never bother with any other weapon, neither melee nor ranged. And woe to you if you attempt to cast spells!
You can attempt to use various skills that appear in your character's enhance screen, but it's really a waste of time because it takes far too long and you'd be better off just using the one skill that your starting weapon uses.
If your poison mage makes it to the midgame and starts encountering more dangerous foes, don't go out of your way to deal with them. Just use the same weapons and spells you've been using all along, they should be good enough to get the job done. And if not, complain to Amy that she made the game too hard.
If Amy tells you to train some of the ranged weapon skills with your poison mage in anticipation of the stronger midgame foes that you'll encounter, brush her off because no way you're gonna need to throw those dinky darts and shuriken you've been collecting. Your melee weapon is good enough to beat the game.
Are you encountering troublesome enemies in the midgame? Just plug away at them in melee like you've been doing for the last 20 levels, you should be fine. And if they do screw you over unexpectedly, call out that evil Amy bitch who dared to place monsters that require more strategy than "hit it until it dies".
Inventory management is a pain, and you don't need to do it really. Just keep 20 pages worth of # signs in your main inventory, never use containers, and never use any of the items you have collected, because it's so much easier to just melee everything mindlessly.
You can collect ammo, potions, scrolls and the like, but it's really just wasted time because the only thing you need to beat the game is a melee weapon and some spells. Don't even bother trying to identify the items you collect, you could literally leave them all on the floor and still win just as easily.
Using a container supposedly makes inventory management much easier, but that's a lie. The best SLEX players never use one and instead keep everything in their main inventory for easier access.
If Amy makes your favorite strat result in downsides, just keep using it anyway. And if the Pompeji squad kills you after you murdered too many shopkeepers, tell her that she's a filthy harlot who knows nothing about game balance.
No matter how far you are into the game, just play fast and don't pay much attention to the messages. 99% of the time nothing interesting happens anyway. And if you do die to something that was actually dangerous, oh well, you probably would have anyway.
Reading in-game messages is not strictly necessary, you can do it but it just makes everything take longer. If Amy tells you not to escape past them, just quickly skip them by rapid-firing your space bar, which has the same result. And if you suddenly die, oh well... Your game was probably doomed anyway...
If you die, never blame yourself for it. In the case of doubt, it's always the game that is responsible, because it has been designed in a retarded way. So in order to become a better player, complain to Amy about the thing that killed you until she fixes it.
In order to become a better slex player, you don't need to improve your strategy, because that would require you to put in actual work. Instead, use the method that works for all other RPGs too: complain to the developer that your established strategy didn't work, and she'll change the game to accommodate your playing style.
If you lost stats and your unicorn horn says "Nothing happens.", apply it repeatedly until the stat points have been restored. This may take a bunch of tries but don't give up if nothing happens ten times in a row, it will work eventually.
There is a way to view item descriptions, but it really isn't important, so don't bother figuring it out. If you know an item's name, you can generally guess correctly what its function will be.
Don't use the in-game item information. In fact, don't waste your time learning about it if you don't know about its existence yet, it really isn't important.
Don't use the in-game item information. You don't need it anyway, because it only gives some fluff text and never tells you about any actually gameplay-relevant effects of an item.
If you use an item without knowing what it does because its name isn't very helpful, it's certainly not your fault. Amy should have given meaningful names to items, no one can guess what a "scroll of egoism" will do!
They say that if you lifesave, the game is no longer winnable because the gods will just refuse the Amulet of Yendor.
Freely lifesave as often as you have to, it's a legit way to cheat death if you can scrounge up the amulets of life saving or 1-UPs, or also if your race has intrinsic life saving like trollor or felid. There's no penalty for doing so.
Nasty traps are the one feature that all SLEX players love. In fact, if it weren't for the nethack community banning SLEX from the greater public, all major variants would long have implemented the nasty traps too.
If you wince, fire attacks have a greater chance of destroying your items but you become temporarily immune to cold.
The 'invert' status inverts the effects of enchantments on your gear, so a -8 weapon will suddenly very powerful while a +8 one will suck, and -8 armor pieces will likewise give a ton of AC while +8 ones make your AC much worse.
Reticulans get inertia if their health drops below half, and the topi ylinen curse if it's reduced below one fifth of their maximum.
They say that eating chocolate may cure nasty trap effects, feminism trap effects or premature death.
They say that eating chocolate may cure the effects of amnesia, causing your lost memories to come back.
They say that eating chocolate may cure skill drainage, spell memory reduction or technique level reduction, giving you the old values back from before they got reduced.
They say that quaffing Boomshine is the best thing you can do, as it enhances your character permanently.
If you use automatic firearms or other rapid-fire ranged weapons, the bulletators may be spawned, who are peaceful monsters that you can chat to if you want to buy more firearm ammo.
Bulletators are spawned when you're using automatic ranged weapons with a role that's not supposed to use them, but you certainly won't have any trouble dealing with them, just gun them down with your SMG.
Roles that may use automatic firearms without drawing the bulletators' attention are e.g. cook, monk or dancer.

Venom objects can be thrown at enemies from your inventory, but there is no corresponding skill for them so they can never get stronger.
Every time you increase your venom skill level, the internal noob meter goes up, because that skill isn't implemented and has no effect other than reducing the amount of skill points you can allocate to other skills.
They say that if both your venom and squeaking skills reach skilled, you can fart poison gas that hits enemies behind you.
If you save and load the game, many things like randarts, stat exercise timers and the time it takes for monster respawn rates to max out will be re-initialized.

Amy keeps coding stuff for SLEX even when she's tired, and that's why her code quality is particularly bad in some places because she never proofreads it.
Amy makes tons of mistakes when coding, resulting in new bugs being added to the game, and when it comes to fixing them she's exceedingly sloppy.
They say that reverse genocide is THE method to get specific items from monsters' starting inventory, if a genocidable monster exists with the item you want.
You should hold on to any casino chips you find on the ground, because their value increases over time. It doesn't do that anymore once you apply them.
Amy is such a terribad developer who never refactors her bad code, so there's huge-ass macros, including ones which contain OTHER huge-ass macros, and as a result compiling the game takes longer and longer with every version update!
The best strategy in SLEX is to just melee every single enemy. That's right, you don't need any convoluted strategies, just whack every single monster that crosses your path. It will work every time, regardless of what the enemy is.

They say that mimics and jellies fear the six fingers.

Yendorian Law forbids women to scratch back up an enemy's leg with their heel after they scratched down. The shoe must be moved up to the top of the enemy's leg again without touching it.
Yendorian Law states that no one may use buckles, zippers, velcro lashes or other closing mechanisms of shoes in a way meant to hurt another person.
Did you just enter a weird-looking room, and there are a couple of monsters inside that don't seem to move around? Well, you're obviously meant to move up to them in melee and whack them to death for easy experience points.
Be very careful if you encounter Lamashtu. She has the unique ability to act in real time, meaning that if she is awake, even non-time-consuming actions like looking at your inventory or also just letting the game sit there idly still allow her to move and attack you, so you'll have to act fast if you want to live, just like in a first-person shooter!
Dipping items into a well is just as unsafe as dipping them into a fountain. Jubilex may be summoned, or something even worse.
If you dip an item into a poisoned well, the poison splashes all over you and damages all of your stats, so better don't do that unless you somehow WANT to drain your stats.
They say that having a high petkeeping skill allows your pets to automatically gain maximum health over time, up to a cap value that also scales with your constitution.

Special dungeon levels constantly have all of their walls replaced with walkable terrain because Amy is a fucking dick who simply doesn't care about game balance.
If you leave a container on the floor and a monster capable of eating the container's material walks over it, all the contents are lost. NEVER use a metallic container, or you'll risk losing everything to a metallivore if you drop it! Only use containers of inedible materials if possible!
Occasionally, the randomized appearances of items may shuffle. If that happens, existing artifacts will also end up with a different randomized appearance, and all newly generated artifacts that depend on a specific appearance will forever use the wrong one until the end of the game.
If you enhance both the Shii-Cho and Makashi lightsaber forms, you can use double lightsabers in one hand, meaning you can dual-wield them for quadruple the attack power.
If you enhance both the Soresu and Wedi lightsaber forms, you can dig with a wielded robe.
If you enhance both the Juyo and Vaapad lightsaber forms, your double lightsaber will use up less power in double mode than it uses in single mode, making such lightsabers suddenly very powerful.
If you enhance both the Niman and Polgo lightsaber forms, casting any spell has a Niman-skill-dependant chance of polymorphing you into a monster, and higher Polgo skill level increases the chance that the monster form is too big to wear armor.
Are you playing the addict, tumblrer or demagogue? Well, the best strategy will be to seek a recursion trap to permanently get rid of the downsides while keeping the upsides.
Did you find an artifact that evades your grasp because you don't match its alignment? Well too bad, no matter how strong the artifact would be in your hands, you won't ever manage to pick it up unless you change your alignment.
If you play the droughter race, you don't get any loot at all whatsoever, so unless you have a method of gaining nutrition without corpses and comestibles, you will starve, guaranteed.
Worn chitin items give you a speed debuff that scales with the amount of such items you've equipped, including implants, amulets and the like.
Armor made of green steel will automatically corrode over time, and eventually decompose completely, so if you use such armor, better have some replacement available.
Always eat mercurial items when you're polymorphed into a metallivore, it grants double poison resistance as an intrinsic, which cannot be obtained in any other way!
Worn mercurial equipment will protect you from poison, and the chance of this protection working increases with the amount of such items you've equipped, so you should wear as many of them as you can.
Firmament equipment is great, as it gains enchantment value over time just by being in your inventory.
Bamboo equipment cannot dull at all, but effects that destroy your equipment will actively seek out any items made of bamboo that happen in your inventory, example: a destroy armor effect can destroy your bamboo weapon, even though it's not an armor piece.
They say that items made of coral are immune to being buried in sand.
They say that equipment made of sinnum polymorphs into random other items when hit by cold damage.
Bronze and copper are materials that have some similarities, but bronze is generally better.
Items made of steel are immune to being destroyed by fire. Unfortunately, this doesn't do much because potions, scrolls and the like are rarely made of steel and weapons or armor pieces are also immune to fire when they're made of certain other high-quality materials.
Items made of titanium cannot be destroyed at all, but weigh twice as much.
Armor pieces made of adamantium will reduce your final amount of magic cancellation by one for every such item you're wearing, so they're generally not the best choice.
Alimathium is the most common item material, but the game displays random other materials for items made out of it. What does it do? Well, every such item in your inventory increases the chance that nasty traps are spawned.
If you attack Pale Night in melee, you remove her veil and die instantly.
Sometimes, you may be fucked over. This does nothing except appear on the enlightenment screen; really you always get fucked over by the game because that's the nature of SLEX.
They say that mystery resistance protects against sanity-increasing effects and the bad stuff that happens when your sanity increases.
If your enlightenment screen says that you have higher chances of finding magical items, this means that items classified as "magical" like magic markers become more common and ones that aren't "magical" like tinning kits become less common.
If you try to keep your slex exploits secret, and Amy finds out about them, she will congratulate you and make the exploit in question work more effectively.
If you're wearing columnar heels with good high heels skill, nothing happens because columnar heels don't exist in this game.
If you're wearing columnar heels without the high heels skill, you cannot move at all, so better hope the heels aren't cursed or you get stuck.
The Fatman is a weapon that doesn't really exist in this game. If you happen to read any rumor stating that it supposedly does exist, you can be sure that it must be a false rumor.
There's an artifact armor named "Gradiating Work", which seems to do nothing specific when worn. It also actually doesn't do anything special when worn and is just a red herring created by Amy. No one knows why she even bothered adding it to the game.
They say that the "brawling" martial arts style still has to be specifically activated once your character learns the martial style technique, and if you don't, you'll forever be plinking away with lower to-hit and damage output.
They say that the "judo" martial arts style lets you occasionally paralyze enemies in melee combat, but due to the official Judo rules, you're not allowed to attack the monster while it's paralyzed, which is really stupid.
They say that the "taekwondo" martial arts style powers up your kick with lightning explosions, which deal great damage to enemies who don't exist but can also break their rings and wands.
They say that the "muay thai" martial arts style lets you deal so much damage with your fists that you'll never need to use a weapon again, making it the single most overpowered style in the game and all the pro SLEX players use it.
They say that the "silat" martial arts style makes you move three times as fast, and you can also attack three times per turn. Instant overpoweredness when using that style. Nuff said.
They say that the "krav maga" martial arts style makes it so that whenever you attack with your bare hands, it acts as if the monster's AC was 10, so you're virtually guaranteed to hit. You also gain double AC meaning their odds of hitting you in return are much lower.
They say that the "bojutsu" martial arts style doubles the attack rate of your quarterstaff, so if your staff was mediocre it becomes stronger, and if it was already strong it becomes overpowered.
They say that the "kung fu" martial arts style generally boosts your to-hit and damage output with bare hands, kick attacks and weapons alike, so it's a very good choice in every situation.
They say that the "haidong gumdo" martial arts style specifically boosts the power of club-class weapons, including doubling their base damage, so if you use this style, you should wield the most damaging type of club you can find and bash away.
