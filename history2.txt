Changelog for SLASH'EM Extended, written by Amy, given in reverse chronological order

2.8.9 - December 2023
- The dumplog also displays the elapsed realtime since the start of the game now.
- Tried to add more hints for new players to guide them to the option that turns the number pad on. Hopefully seasoned players will also read the part where it tells them how to turn those messages off.
- Fixed several vanilla and SLASH'EM bugs where timed items (e.g. oil lamps or potions of oil) weren't getting their age variable set correctly.

- The game now counts how many times the player escapes past messages, and displays them in the conduct screen.
- Artifacts that invoke for blackjack don't require zorkmids to play now.
- Hopefully fixed the issue where dead monsters could sometimes still pick up items and swallow them (because the monster was no longer there, so there was no way to kill it and make it drop the items).
- Fixed some issues where functions that were supposed to run in the Gehennom subdungeon specifically, were also running in other subdungeons flagged as "hellish".

2.8.8 - December 2023
- Purposefully mimicking something via the #monster command costs mana now and can train the squeaking skill.

- Added capoeira as a hidden martial arts style.
- Fixed an age-old issue where the wand of remove resistance would typically try to remove several intrinsics from the player with a single zap.
- Some feminism traps have stronger versions of their effects now.
- Rebalanced the level difficulty, especially later into the game, to hopefully prevent the game from bombarding the player with endless amounts of high-level supermonsters.

- Added new skills for the different types of high heels.

- Re-adjusted the player's HP and Pw regeneration rates somewhat.
- Overhauled the loot reduction chances in the late game.
- Fixed an oversight that prevented items from being dipped into water tunnels.
- Fixed issues where monsters would sometimes take very long to eat specific items. This was particularly annoying for pets.

- Wizard mode now allows the player to polymorph into invalid monster forms and increase the polymorph duration, for testing purposes.
- Added a potential fix for the problem where pets would sometimes drop their weapon upon saving and loading the game.

- Fixed a crash bug with the boomerang, which was inadvertently introduced by an earlier change.
- Fixed certain artifact invocation effects that generated items without initializing the generated items properly.

- The monster spawn rate can now occasionally fluctuate between higher and lower values.

2.8.6 - August 2023

- Reaching certain in-game milestones now rewards players with additional skill points.
- Fixed a vanilla oversight that caused non-charged rings to never spawn blessed for some reason.
- Clairvoyance now reveals a much smaller area of the map, and carrying the Amulet of Yendor no longer gives that property.
- In evilvariant mode, dungeons that go up (like Sokoban) now increase their level difficulty the lower the displayed depth is (feature from the variant that calls itself Nethack 3.7).
- Spells no longer act as blessed consumables, and the remove curse spell can no longer uncurse wielded items that aren't weapons.

- The more trophies the player obtains, the more likely items are now to spawn with their enchantment or BUC known.
- Fixed potential exploits where players could get the stat boosts from rings or cornuthaums permanently.
- Artifacts that were supposed to give stun resistance now actually do so. Also, players have a chance of being able to pick up an artifact that would normally "evade their grasp", but it may take a couple attempts.

- Slightly reduced the average level difficulty early in the game.
- If the player suffers from spell amnesia while having no spells memorized, they suffer from magic vacuum instead.
- Monsters use gaze attacks against pets less often.
- Nerfed the fixing and stone to flesh spells, and casting acid-elemental spells at yourself while you're turning to stone damages your maximum HP.

- Upon reaching certain in-game milestones, specific artifacts that cannot generate randomly will become capable of doing so.
- Changed the timeouts for several techniques.

weapon.

- Items can be dipped into a (poisoned) well now.
- Higher petkeeping skill now increases the maximum HP of a newly obtained pet if it was below a certain threshold, which scales with skill level and charisma. Symbiosis skill does the same for newly obtained symbiotes.
- Monsters that eat containers will no longer delete the container's contents. Instead, the contents are generally transferred to the monster's inventory.

- Certain highly damaging types of trap deal less damage to low-level characters now to cut down on unfair instadeaths before you have a chance to survive them.
- If a player character's stat would have been drained below the minimum, and it's not something like mind flaying that results in an instadeath, it now drains the player character's alla; previously, nothing would happen at all in such a situation.

- Early game experience requirements for leveling up have been changed slightly to speed up the early game.
- Fixed the vanilla bug where SPFX_LUCK (the attribute on artifacts that make them act like luckstones) would always assume that the item gave this effect when carried, even when it was specified in artilist.h that it should only do so when the item is equipped.

2.8.3 - January 2023
- Fixed an issue where lightsabers wouldn't always consume the proper amount of energy per turn.
- Fixed the jedi patch bug where dual-wielding lightsabers and then using certain ways to switch to other weapons would leave the (now no longer wielded) off-hand lightsaber to remain lit.
- Using the force on a monster will wake up the monster unconditionally now; previously, it only woke up tame ones.
- In evilvariant mode, magic whistles no longer work on no-teleport levels.

- As the game goes on, high-level monsters will become gradually less uncommon to ensure that game difficulty goes up if the player procrastinates.

- The effects of purchasing a shopkeeper's uncursing service while impaired are much less likely to be beneficial and have a chance of putting powerful curses on the item instead.
- Symbiotes now weigh much more if the player's skill is low, and having low charisma makes them take longer to regenerate hit points but high charisma speeds up their regeneration.

- Restored the ability to drop gold by selecting $ in the drop menu, fixing the bug where the game would say "The LRS would be very interested in knowing you had that much".
- If the player unchecks all item types in the autopickup options menu, the character should now properly not autopickup anything (except thrown objects if pickup_thrown is TRUE) anymore instead of picking up everything.

However, metal spellcasting penalties are lower, making spellcasting in plate mail more feasible.
- Several changes to make it harder to secure an endless food supply via stone to flesh.
- Engraving with a wand can now cause it to explode, with the same chance as zapping it.

- Monsters that can cast spells will do so more rarely, and the mechanic for selecting which spell to cast has also been overhauled.

- Recharging a lightsaber no longer caps the total amount of power at 1500. Also, lightsabers and light sources now show how much energy they have left if they're fully identified.
- A message is given if the player uses up a tool owned by a shopkeeper.
- The ancient race is once again capable of getting any random technique at game start, except those learned from training skills.
- In evilvariant mode, the prompt given by a cursed scroll of identify is more realistic.
- Toned down the message spam when searching in soviet mode.
- Fixed the bug where monsters attacking each other in soviet mode would always cause their weapons to rust.
- The uncurse service offered by shopkeepers works now even if the shopkeeper doesn't handle the item. Also improved the message given when using the identify service.
- Fixed the bug where dying from quaffing a poisoned well would give a "glorkum 0 0 0" death message.

2.2.3 - June 2018
- If a blind player tries to search and causes a statue trap to animate, it no longer illogically stops the searching from finding stuff on the other adjacent tiles.
- Fixed an error where shopkeepers would sometimes not reduce the amount of money they have when giving money to the player.
- Eating a human wraith corpse can give an experience level now.
- Fixed the long-standing rnd() call error when certain monsters got spawned.
- New playable roles: Anachronounbinder, Hussy and Mason.
- New skill: sexy flats. Trained by wearing certain pieces of footwear.
- The nexus stat swap effect can damage the player's attributes or maximum HP.
- Turn undead works less well with low alignment, and not at all if it's too low.
- Potions of blood can be removed from the loot, and hostile vampires can actually use them now.
- Changed the experience chart for experience level 14-30 so that it takes much longer to reach higher levels.
- Fixed the bug where engravings were shown on grayout tiles.
- New option randomhybrids that can be turned off to prevent random hybrid races when playing in curses mode.
- Improved the gang scholar quest levels.
- Fixed the bug where material glyphs would still be displayed while under the uninformation trap effect.
- New monster attacks: destroy weapon/armor, trembling, and ragnarok.
- Traps have a difficulty value now, which determines how hard it is to find/detect them. In some games, a value is rolled at game start that gets added to this difficulty.
- Using #annotate when the current level already has an annotation will tell the player what the annotation is.
- There's a 1 in X chance, with X randomly determined at game start, for a randomly generated trap to be completely random, ignoring the rarity numbers on the nastier trap types.
- Twoweaponing can occasionally have greatly reduced to-hit, and deals less damage on average.
- 1 in 8192 monsters are "shiny" and randomly change color.
- The wand of magic mapping no longer maps the entire level.
- If the player is causing conflict, monsters are much more likely to ignore Elbereth squares.
- The Bizarro Orgasmatron will give long-lasting inertia if the player uses it too often.
- Trying to use a cursed instrument at the castle makes the drawbridge lie to you.
- Player's displacement and invisibility are less likely to fool monsters.
- Monsters with AD_SEDU are better at stealing stuff compared to AD_SITM ones now.
- Some of the lightsaber forms train faster now.
- Lots of nerfs, including bonuses from achievements, damage bonuses for highly skilled weapons, and other boosts for highly skilled players.
- Items can be "finalized", which prevents them from being cancelled, polymorphed, blanked etc. Cancelling a negatively enchanted item will now only remove one point of negative enchantment, and cursed items will only be uncursed if they no longer have a negative enchantment value. The cancellation spell in particular can require many zaps to remove negative enchantment from an item and can also occasionally make the item finalized.
- Towels can degrade when used, and are only reliable when blessed.
- Magic markers are less common as randomly generated loot.
- If the player is wearing positively enchanted gloves, it will allow them to hit monsters that require +X weapons to hit if the gloves' enchantment is high enough.
- Monsters' AC is now less likely to get reduced.
- Numbness should have noticeable effects now.
- Players polymorphed into fast monsters (speed 18 or higher) now gives a lower average polymorph time, and the player's polymorph in such a form can time out even if the player is unchanging.
- Riding a fast steed will reduce the speed (based upon player's riding skill) starting at a speed of 18 now (was 25).
- The detect armor enchantment and know enchantment spells only work on some items now. Passwall spell can backfire.
- Fake artifacts can now be deleted from the loot, reducing the # that the player will get.
- Polearms may erode when used, or frenzy the monster, or speed up the monster. Monsters that can use weapons have a chance of snatching the polearm.
- Polypiling has a greater chance of shuddering the object, especially if it's a scroll, potion, spellbook, or stackable weapon, and even if the item survives, it may become cursed and lose enchantment.
- Reduced the amount of charges that certain wands spawn with.
- Riding a very fast steed may cause the player to walk randomly.
- Exploding monsters whose base types can resurrect will now be able to do so after exploding (previously they wouldn't ever leave corpses).
- Self-hybrid player characters can't apply tools or zap wands on turns divisible by 3, and will not see monsters via warning, telepathy etc. on such turns either.

2.2.2 - April 2018
- Fixed a bug where certain rings were chargeable even though their charge had no effect.
- Some dungeon branches, especially the subquest but also Gehennom and the Yendorian Tower, will provide less loot.
- The turn undead technique is now less effective and has a timeout. #turn will no longer work, but give a message to use the technique instead.
- Fixed a SLASH'EM bug that caused double lightsabers to not deactivate properly if you switched to a different weapon while both blades were lit.
- Fixed an oversight that caused monsters' ranged attacks to never hit the player if the player was wielding a lit lightsaber.
- Regrouped bones files since the previous method of changing their file names didn't work. Dungeon branches with similar difficulty levels now share bones files because sadly, there is a limit of 26 different bones characters.
- In evilvariant mode, the game will not tell the player what item got stolen by a nymph.
- Fixed a couple errors that allowed the player's maximum HP to be set to zero.
- Armor pieces will now tell the player what slot they use when accessing their description.
- Spirit bomb technique's damage scales better with higher technique levels.
- When the player gets the chance to break an enemy's weapon, the game will now tell the player what the weapon is before asking if they really want to break it.
- Added extrainfo to display the player's in-game location in the dgamelaunch watch menu.

- Fixed a segfault when a ridden steed engulfs a monster.
- Added some fields to the whereis file.
- Fixed a bug where a player wearing cone heels would sometimes take no damage from a monster attack.
- The Unix Makefile should compile the game with debug symbols by default again.
- Fixed SIGFPE crashes when removing an implant set the player's max HP to zero.
- The CSPRNG had to be disabled for now because it was causing unbearable amounts of lag.
- Added more ways in which skills can be untrainable, and fixed the logic in the random selection code.
- Aggravate monster works differently now depending on whether the player has it intrinsically, extrinsically or both. The extrinsic has more detrimental effects.
- New option "eatingconfirm" that gives a y/n prompt when trying to eat a non-comestible, to make it less likely for the player to accidentally eat their weapon when polymorphed into e.g. a metallivore.
- The castle and Sokoban have fake engravings in certain places now.
- Restoring a game in curses mode while hallucinating should no longer corrupt the save.
- Feeling like a new man can re-initialize intelligence and wisdom.
- Made it less likely for buffer overruns to occur when the bones file ID is checked.
- Added a new possible pentagram effect that can remove intrinsic aggravate monster.

2.2.1 - April 2018
- Implants skill can allow the player to take off items from underneath cursed other items, with the skill level determining what can and can't be removed.
- Changes to evilvariant mode: player cannot engrave while being held by a monster, reading scrolls with low intelligence can occasionally give the confused effect, falling asleep causes the player to slap to the floor and lose a few HP, and zapping a wand doesn't work if the player's hands are unusable.
- Fixed an old segfault with roles that get random pantheons, which was introduced accidentally when the Medium role was added.
- Ragnarok can instakill the player and/or pets in evilvariant mode.
- Fixed the buffer overrun that could happen if the player accesses the pokedex on a very large terminal. The entries might look weird now due to the new way of formatting, though.
- Added lightsaber forms as new skills.

- Early dungeon levels occasionally have additional chests placed randomly.
- Being engulfed in evilvariant mode can confuse the player.
- Gods in evilvariant mode are harder to mollify the angrier they are.

- Skills that the player is restricted in cannot be trained by potions of training and similar effects.

2.1.9 - April 2018
- Artifact gifts are livelogged.
- The recover tool should now be able to correctly handle the increased amount of dungeon levels in the game.

- The actual level of randomly generated monsters is lower on average.
- Monsters' ranged weapons deal less damage to the player now. They also get lower multishot bonuses on average.
- Long worms have a significantly lower chance of dropping a worm tooth now.
- The searching skill works better now by giving bigger boosts to the chance of finding something.
- Removed the possibility of saving a buglog when obfree() was called on a non-empty container, because it was causing lots of issues and had no actual benefit.

- Toned down the chance of getting extra hard levels in Gehennom.
- Monster groups are smaller on average.

- If the player resists a nymph's attempt to steal a worn item or artifact, the player can now opt to have the item get stolen anyway.
- Magic portals on the Subquest and Yendorian Tower don't always work.
- Added messages about contamination to warn the player that it can kill them.
- The missingno and segfaulter races no longer crash. Segfaulter gives fake segfault messages instead and kills the player character.
- Fixed an error that could cause garbage strings to screw up Unix terminals.
- The mystic role starts with a random implant.
- Added boss monsters, artifacts and other stuff to the new dungeon branches.
- Higher charisma affects the chances of taming a pet and the resistance of pets to untaming effects.
- Added more possible contents for randomly generated tins.
- Spellcaster monsters whose spell "attacks" use non-standard damage types can actually use them against the player now.
- Increased the maximum permissible amount of skill advancements to make sure there's no errors when the player has enhanced a lot of skills.
- If the player loses skill points in evil variant mode, the loss can be permanent.
- Added more effects when eating gray stones.
- New birth option "supergmmode" that allows every watcher to generate monsters via sending mail with "genesis monstername" (replace "monstername" with the name of an actually existing monster species).
- New option "graffitihilite" that will highlight engravings on the floor, defaults to on.
- Changed the color of branch staircases to pink.
- Fixed errors where blindness or wounded legs would sometimes never wear off.
- Tried to make sure every special level can be completed without having to squeeze through diagonal gaps, and without needing to teleport or wallwalk, because the game should be winnable for sokosolver lostsouls too.
- Shopkeeper weapon-works/appraisal services can be used on iron balls, chains and gems now.
- Reduced the amount of items the player gets, especially later in the game.

2.1.8 - March 2018
- When ash and farmland burn up, they usually turn into regular floor now; they only rarely become ash. Also, rain clouds can be boiled with fire, turning them into normal clouds.
- Randomly generated items may occasionally be erosionproof and/or eroded.
- Crypt, trouble zone and feminism rooms will now often spawn with a container.
- Graves have the "saved by the bell" inscription much less often.
- Monsters have death drops less often, and the player also generally receives less items as the game goes on.
- Monster respawn speeds up a bit more slowly and reaches a lower maximum value. However, once the player has fully imbued the Amulet of Yendor, the old (higher) maximum will be used from that point on.
- The first major oracle consultation increases the player's intelligence and wisdom by one.
- Removed a pager.c random message that was suspected of screwing up terminal sessions.
- Many prompts are now harder to accidentally skip: some y/n prompts now require a full "yes", directional and item selection prompts allow the player to retry when dismissed via the space bar, etc.
- Triggering a level teleporter in evilvariant mode now blinds the player.
- Player characters that always recognize BUC of items can now train spirituality by identifying unknown item types or buying protection. Using turn undead can train spirituality for all non-chaotic characters if it outright kills an undead creature.
- High heels do extra damage to monsters with tentacle attacks.
- When the dazzle technique fails to make contact with any monster, it still gets a timeout and uses up a turn.
- Fixed the vanilla 3.4.3 bug that caused level drain to not reduce the player's polymorphed HP even though gaining levels correctly increased them.
- In evil variant mode, door explosions will burn the player's items.
- Gang scholar gods are less likely to fix troubles when they are angry, or when the player's alignment/luck are negative. Also, stoning and sliming are less likely to be cured.
- Ghosts (the plain "ghost" monster, because it can be infinitely farmed in haunted temples) no longer have death drops.
- Addict race starts with 25 in all stats (the non-strength ones used to start at 125).
- The mysterious force exists again when playing in evilvariant mode.
- Added a wallglyph option that, when turned off, makes solid rock not shown as # anymore.
- Playing on a public server during June will tell the player about options that are incompatible with the tournament.
- When applying a stack of grenades, only one grenade is armed now.
- Added a materialglyph option that causes items to display their material.
- Added sit messages for more types of furniture.
- If a monster throws a potion of radium, cyanide or urine at the player, the status line correctly updates now.
- Item selection menus allow the player to select unidentified items specifically. Also, many of the options are now inaccessible while hallucinating because that was leaking info.
- If the player kicks a tree that has already tried to drop fruit, a message is given telling them that there's no fruit on the tree.
- Fixed a loophole/message bug with repeatedly dropping and picking back up certain macguffins.
- Nerfed some overcrowded dungeon levels and special rooms to make them less unplayable (they just had too many monsters and/or annoying terrain).
- Some spells now deal less damage to the player's maximum HP/Pw when cast.
- The Bell Caves as well as the three branches from the Yendorian Tower cause relocatitis now, so if the initial relocation causes the player to spawn in a place from where there's no escape (think sokosolver nastinator with intrinsic anti-teleportation), the game doesn't become unwinnable. Also, there's a general 1 in 10000 chance of spontaneous relocation unless the player is on the planes, which allows the player to choose whether they really want to be relocated.
- The message about the number pad is controlled by the numpadmessage option now. Also, the game will now ask the player whether they want to enable/disable the number pad.
- Added a bunch of new intrinsics, techniques and skills, and the all-new "implants" item slot that counts as an accessory.
- When the player's starting weapon skills start out good enough, the disarm technique will be known from the start.
- In wonderland mode, the player will be instantly teleported out of the elder priest's temple if the game somehow spawns the player inside.
- On the Nightmare's Gauntlet level, if the player somehow ends up to the west of the artifact door where they would be unable to unlock it since the key is on the other side, the door will automatically unlock.
- The player can decide whether they want to be homosexual when they encounter a foocubus for the first time.
- Monsters rattling their bones have a hallucination message.
- Added a bunch of dungeon branches to the main Dungeons of Doom and Gehennom.
- Bones files are named differently now, which allows them to work on all newly added subdungeons.

2.1.7 - February 2018
- Reduced the generation chance of cursed graves and their rate of undead creation. Also reduced the amount of monsters seeded on certain terrain types.
- Fixed a bug that got introduced earlier, which caused cockatrice eggs thrown by the player to crash.
- Reduced the amount of kelp frond being generated on watery levels.
- Trying to use a pick-axe while stuck in a web and failing will now force a --More-- unless the corresponding option was turned off.
- Monster-versus-monster passive rust attacks are limited to actual passive attacks; a pet attacking a gray ooze should no longer result in the pet's weapon being rusted, since the gray ooze's rusting attack is a bite attack and not a passive attack.
- If the player can swim, they can now pick up items from the water even while flying.
- Hostile giants will no longer pick up statues.
- Eating a luckstone can change the player's luck, depending on the stone's BUC. Eating a shimmering dragon can give or remove a random intrinsic.
- If the player's unicorn horn skill goes up, the horn effectively acts like it had an extra +1 per skill point, and also becomes less likely to turn to dust.
- Amulets can be pseudo-identified by dropping them down a toilet. Every amulet has its own unique message. However, the amulet can be cursed or rusted, or it can also be consumed, in which case monsters will be summoned.
- Sacrificing a high-value corpse has a much higher chance of the gods giving an artifact gift.
- If the player is confused or stunned, and not playing a race that gets those status effects permanently, there is a chance of falling down stairs.
- Being hit by an archon's blindness gaze gives a special message while hallucinating.
- In evil variant mode, if a bag of holding or digestion deletes items, the player will not be told which items have been deleted.
- Added a special message if the player starts or restores a game while hallucinating during a full moon.

- Monsters are much better at avoiding traps, particularly holes in Sokoban.
- Added some more ways for the elder priest to become covetous.
- Droven bolts no longer weigh a whole weight unit.
- Fixed (hopefully) some badly defined regions on the elder priest level that could cause the player or downstairs to spawn inside the temple.
- Reading a scroll of punishment while confused angers the gods, or mollifies them if the scroll was blessed.
- Cursed evil artifacts are very hard to destroy. Also, fixed an error where eternium or sticky cursed items could still sometimes be destroyed by rust.
- Erosionproof items have a chance to resist disintegration or destroy armor.
- If you try to create a potion or write a scroll that you have identified earlier, the game now tells you the cost and then asks whether you really want to create it. Also, it is no longer possible to have the game leak information about unidentified scrolls by using a marker that has just barely less than twice the required amount of ink.
- Cannibalism in evilvariant mode will increase god anger.
- Door and container traps in evilvariant mode will always surround the player with invisible traps.
- If the player uses create familiar while hallucinating, there is an extra message displayed.
- The elder priest now takes lots of extra damage when the player uses high heels on him.
- Fixed an error that caused quiz traps to occasionally display non-rumors as questions, where the player could only guess what the right answer is.
- Fixed an oversight that caused super stealth ants to not spawn invisible.
- The room-joining code can now dig paths through edge tiles too.
- Shop walls can no longer be razed by panic digging, wands of opening, confused scrolls of lockout, tunnelization spells or ragnarok.
- Spellbook descriptions include the level of the spell.
- The appraisal service offered by shopkeepers will now identify the enchantment value of weapons.
- Fixed an exploit in wonderland mode that allowed the player to get the Amulet of Yendor without having to do the invocation ritual.
- Added flavor messages for the Gang Scholar role.
- Added special levels for the Dungeons of Doom and Gehennom.
- Halved the chance for listener race player characters to find random artifacts.
- Monsters with paralysis attacks have free action.

2.1.6 - February 2018
- Closed drawbridges no longer erroneously display "grayout" when farlooked.
- Walls don't randomly spawn in undiggable locations to prevent the game from becoming nearly unwinnable.
- Added lairs for 12 of the new demon lords.
- Fixed a bug introduced by an earlier commit that caused the game to segfault when the player used unarmed combat.
- Saddles of ridden steeds are now much less likely to be stolen by hostile item-stealers.
- Fixed a panic that could occur when an immunizer character enters a new dungeon level.
- All temple priests are elder priests in evil variant mode. Also added some wand destruction patch stuff to evil variant mode.
- Wand recharging has been improved to reflect the new maximum # of charges that the wands can have upon generation.
- Added new playable races: aggravator, evilvariant, felid, levelscaler, listener, salamander, shoe.

2.1.5 - January 2018
- The gang scholar role can have various negative status effects randomly fixed by their deity while not in Gehennom.
- If the elder priest's tentacle attack destroys one of the player's pieces of equipment, he will mock the player with a scornful message.
- If the player is wielding a quarterstaff, the penalties for wearing metallic equipment are reduced, making spells easier to cast.
- Added some negative results when the player quaffs from a fountain, and a few less harmful (but still bad) ones when dipping stuff in a fountain.
- If an artifact is generated, there is now a 1% chance that the artifact does not count as "already generated", meaning another copy of it can be found or wished for in the same game.
- The random chance of "feeling like a new man" when polymorphing has been reduced.
- When playing as the snail race, potions of salt water are very dangerous and can also be thrown by monsters.
- Implemented the sporkhack room joining code for rooms-and-corridors levels, which can occasionally generate levels that look a little different.
- Made shops more common.
- Random engravings on dungeon levels aren't always graffiti but can also be dust engravings or burned ones.
- Randomly generated wands have a higher average amount of charges in them.
- Some changes to ranged weapon generation and ammo mulch rates to make the player less likely to run out of ammo.
- The nuclear chamber special room has a lower density of styx rivers and contamination traps.
- Fixed errors with weapon attacks: Martial arts really doesn't work if the player triggered the trap that prevents skills from working, bashing with launchers or polearms no longer does excessive amounts of damage, and throwing arrows/bullets/etc. without wielding the corresponding launcher gives a message telling the player about it.

2.1.4 - January 2018
- Added a few special levels for Sheol and some Jubilex lairs.

2.1.3 - January 2018
- Telekinesis can no longer be used on items inside shops. This prevents a potential segfault from occurring because I don't know how to fix the segfault itself.
- Fixed an error where failed artifact wishes would sometimes allow you to try to wish for something again.
- Fixed a segfault that would happen when the player entered a quest filler level while under the effect of recursion. In the case of permanent recursion those levels would become permanently inaccessible due to the bug!
- Fixed an error that caused the conduct encoding in the record file to interact incorrectly with the added "prayerless" conduct.
- Fixed erroneous stats of "Bitchy Lara's hugging boot" and "Bitchy Lara's block-heeled boot" monsters.
- When the Bell of Opening is imbued, monsters are spawned around the exit of the Bell Caves and will try to prevent the player from getting out. Since the player cannot level/branchport while in the Bell Caves, combat with those monsters is very hard to avoid.
- The player can play in wonderland mode via OPTIONS=wonderland now. This puts the player on level 1 of the Yendorian Tower, disables level/branchporting, and the goal is to get to the portal on level 100. If the player manages to do that, they are teleported to level 1 of the Dungeons of Doom and levelporting becomes possible again.
- There is an elder priest on the topmost Yendorian Tower level now. He is by far the most dangerous monster in the game with bisection, decapitation, ragnarok and data delete melee attacks, and of course he can tentacle to tentacle you and cast spells and stuff. He holds a unique artifact that cannot be wished for: a robe that conveys magic resistance, reflection, +5 increase damage and accuracy, and 20% better spellcasting success chances when worn. Oh, and he resurrects a few turns after being killed and eating his corpse is instantly fatal.

2.1.2 - December 2017
- Rain clouds no longer are valid teleport destinations.
- The displacement property allows the player to displace peaceful monsters. Shopkeepers and temple priests are exempt.
- Chatting to a priest and receiving zorkmids for an ale will say "bitcoins" while hallucinating.
- The player's intelligence now slightly increases carry capacity. This increase is not subject to monster weight calculations when the player is polymorphed, making it especially useful when the player polymorphs into a very small monster.
- Items can now have a "sticky curse", or get one when they become cursed. An item that has this type of curse cannot be stolen by nymphs, cannot be destroyed by rust or other types of erosion, and will never come off when the player polymorphs. Scrolls of remove curse and holy water can still uncurse such items, and if successful, will also remove the sticky curse.
- The game no longer tries to delete armed grenades. This might fix a double free or corruption bug.
- When the player loses wisdom due to contamination, the game now actually says that wisdom has been lost, and the status line correctly updates to reflect the player's reduced wisdom.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the Catherine's Sexuality artifact cloak from instakilling you.
- Reduced the odds that a random gem is a "nasty gray stone".
- Silenced the level compiler warning about monsters/traps/items being in walls, as these are not level design errors, but intended behavior. They work just fine when they're placed in walls.
- The sustainer race is highly resistant to wisdom loss from contamination.
- Dropping an item on an altar of Moloch can occasionally curse it if its BUC status was not known.
- Fixed the exploit where genociding oneself could make monsters stop attacking.
- Hydra bows and wildhild bows are two-handed now.
- Elemental mages can only use their dragon transformation once in a while.
- When in a form that can ooze under doors, the player can now actually do so as long as the total weight of all items is below a certain threshold.
- Cleansing bought from aligned priests no longer instantly removes all negative alignment.
- The horn horse actually has a horn now.
- If you talk to the quest leader after permanently converting yourself, the leader and guardians can become hostile.
- Fixed an oversight that caused some of the new terrain types to not update on the screen when they changed into different terrains.
- Fixed a potential segfault when encountering a bones level on which the previous player has died with a wielded, lit lightsaber.
- Traps are more common when the player gets deeper down in the dungeon.
- The Bell of Opening has to be imbued in the Bell Caves, which is accessed by finding a portal on the Quest that leads to the Subquest, and finding the downstair to the Bell Caves there. Without imbuing it, none of the invocation tools work, so this is a mandatory step to complete the game. Also, the Amulet of Yendor has to be imbued by visiting three one-level branches in the Yendorian Tower, which is accessed by finding a portal on Moloch's Sanctum. As long as the Amulet is not fully imbued, ascension is impossible.
- Hangup penalties are put in a define; the game now tracks how many times the player hangs up, but unless HANGUPPENALTY is enabled (it defaults to off), the only thing that happens upon hanging up is a few turns of paralysis. Hanging up at a pending instadeath like "You die from your illness" still greets you with a DYWYPI instadeath upon restoring, of course.
- Fixed the character selection prompt for the curses interface (thanks FIQ).
- Tweaked the numbers for aggravate monster, kops being summoned by shoplifting etc. to make the game less insanely difficult.
- Dungeon size increased. The main dungeon is 100 levels in length now, and the total amount of levels in the dungeon will be bigger than the 127 limit.

2.1.1 - November 2017
- Greatly reduced the rate at which kop cubes and boss spawners will spawn new stuff.
- Improved some to-hit calculations to make the game easier.
- Some improvements to the curses interface in an attempt to make the HUD no longer inferior to tty mode.
- Fixed the bug where the starlit sky trap would fail to obscure the identities of minions and priests.
- Fixed a long-standing bug where certain quest artifacts could generate randomly or be given as gifts.
- Ether equipment contamination rate reduced greatly.
- Fix several errors with the cursed curses interface.
- Lethe attacks can now turn the player's magical items into mundane ones. Also, the data delete attack that disenchants the player's inventory can affect items that are already at -1 or worse now.
- The artifact potion of water correctly blesses itself upon being picked up now.
- Tried for the umpteenth time to fix the savegame error; this time it apparently occured in obstructedX() for some reason...
- Fixed a bug where applying a tool could occasionally segfault the game.
- Added another possible data delete effect, which curses and disenchants the player's entire inventory.
- Controlled levelporting does not work in the quest. If the player levelports in the quest, it will always be uncontrolled.
- Fixed a bug where the deafness trap would never time out correctly. The player would no longer be under the trap's effect, but sound effects would still not display because the flags.soundok flag was never set to 1 again!
- Hitting spacebar or otherwise a wrong key at the spell direction prompt will never direct the spell at the player themselves, even if that was the previously used direction; in such a case it will zap the spell in a random direction now. Also, self-zapping with finger of death is no longer an instadeath if the player is magic resistant; it reduces d20 max HP instead.

2.1.0 - October 2017
- Falling into lava without fire resistance is not an instakill anymore unless the player has very few max HP; otherwise, it will now reduce the max by half and put the player into lava, which is a delayed instadeath.
- When under the effect of the auto destruct trap, the player can now successfully read spellbooks or dig with a pick-axe.
- Some cloned quest levels (e.g. the Rogue quest goal level) could make the game almost impossible to win when they spawned in the regular dungeon; think sokosolver lostsoul, who cannot levelport past the level in question but also cannot phase through walls even when polymorphing into a form that can. Made sure all areas on those levels can be reached by walking.
- Added a M5_EVIL flag, and classified some monsters as such. Variant rooms can sometimes be filled with only monsters that have this flag.
- Chatting to a nurse with enough money offers a decontamination service.
- Valkyries can always throw Mjollnir, regardless of strength.
- The menu_glyphs option works on Windows now.
- Thoroughly eroded ranged weapons will always break when thrown.
- Searching while blind will not fail to search every square when one of the squares contains a monster.
- Fixed a bug where monsters would throw cockatrice eggs at a player who was already turning to stone.
- Added a data delete attack that does very evil things if the player gets hit with it.
- Any square on a newly-generated dungeon level has a minuscule chance of containing a trap.
- Added new roles: Feminist, Nuclear Physicist, Tracer, Form Changer and Gang Scholar.
- Added a missile weapons skill, a new technique (decontamination) and a new intrinsic (contamination resistance).
- Prostitute and kurwa roles have a chance to not be paralyzed by a claw attack. The chance of chain-paralysis when already paralyzed has been reduced in particular.
- Added new item materials: ether, eternium and brick.

2.0.9 - September 2017
- Added anoter possible negative effect to fountain quaffing.
- A player standing on a crystal water tile was able to quaff from it, which was not intended. Fixed.
- Hostile werecreatures have a chance of summoning more monsters in a single summon.
- Fixed an oversight that prevented switching from wizard to explore mode more than once.
- The zombieman has a much lower chance of starting with the stronger energy gun ammos, which is supposed to make the doomed barracks special room less deadly for a low-level player.
- Changed monster population formula for special rooms, which should randomize their "filled-ness" more than before. Also toned down the amount of monsters in certain types of rooms, especially the otherwise far too dangerous void room.
- Pseudo objects, used for e.g. hallucination and spellcasting, can no longer be artifacts, and if they become fake artifacts they won't increase the fake artifact counter.
- Fixed an error introduced by an earlier commit which made it possible to tame any domestic monster with any type of food.
- If a pet is leashed or the player has recently used a tin whistle, the "tracking code" will be disabled. This makes the pet follow more closely, but can cause it to get stuck in a U-turn.
- Changed regions in some special levels, which enables them to be filled with monsters in ironman mode. This causes a few issues on certain levels, most prominently a "Cannot place branch!" error; the way the game originally handled this was very stupid, because it entered an infinite loop. 0/10, vanilla devteam. Sorry. Anyway, I changed it so it simply forces the branch to be placed anyway, and since this can cause magic portals to appear in a wall, I added extra code to transform the terrain underneath a generated magic portal to a walkable one (water still counts as walkable, so ad aquarium vaults should work like they used to).
- Migohives now have a chance of spawning a wider variety of migos, including the "gomi" monsters from dnethack.
- Monsters that use the MS_BONES sound, e.g. skeletons, can now rattle while near the player. Unless the player makes a saving throw based on magic cancellation, this will cause 2 turns of paralysis.
- Fixed a bug where "hmnen" levels could never be generated due to a typo.
- If a rooms-and-corridors level is generated in Gehennom, there is a higher than usual chance of it containing special rooms.
- The Gehennom trophy can only be gotten by entering through the front entrance, which is the downstair on the Valley of the Dead.
- If you die with 0 points, the game will call you a noob.
- Fixed a bug where it was impossible to pick up an object on a crystal water tile. Also, it should no longer be possible to dip items into crystal water that you shouldn't be able to reach.
- Levitator race player characters will pick up an entire stack of objects now if they use one of their tools or the telekinesis techniques.
- The nopet option is ignored if the player uses the Kurwa role; they will start with a pet regardless of the option setting now.
- Monsters in doomed barracks generate with less ammo.
- The water bolt spell is now level 6 instead of 1, considering how powerful it is.
- Tried again to fix the bug where tools being destroyed on use (e.g. unicorn horns randomly vanishing, but also the vanilla behavior of cursed crystal balls exploding) could produce a segfault because somehow arti_speaks was called even though it should not. However, I fear the bug may still exist...
- Added GM mode (Game Master mode), which is turned on with the OPTIONS=gmmode line in the options file. It allows me (Amy) to send mail to the player to spawn monsters. Also added a gmmessage option that defaults to on; if turned off, the player will not be told which monsters I'm spawning.
- Fixed the bug where once the player's Vorpal Blade decapitates a monster, it could then be thrown to automatically decapitate monsters as long as no further melee attacks are used.

2.0.8 - September 2017
- Fixed a panic bug when trying to light a stack of cursed torches (bug present in SLASH'EM too).

2.0.7 - September 2017
- Fixed the long-standing bug where hallucinated appearances for tools would cause obj_is_local segfault panics (corrupting the savegame beyond repair) when the temporary hallucinated tool was a container that contained a timed object (e.g. an egg). This bug exists in SLASH'EM too.
- Added missing descriptions for some new monster traits that were added in previous versions.
- Shoplifting can increase the cop wanted level by an amount relative to how much the stolen merchandise cost.
- Fixed a segfault when eating a tin of black hole blob.
- Crystal water uses the correct glyph in DECgraphics mode now.
- Ctrl-P at a prompt really doesn't work while under certain nasty trap effects (it used to be possible to circumvent those trap effects to a certain degree!).
- Unicorn horns fix status effects first, and only if there are none that can be fixed, it will try to fix lost attribute points.
- Bundle monsters should have specific melee attack messages, but I found out they aren't being displayed since the attack types don't match. Maybe I'll add them later.
- Switched to a different method of determining the message on a t-shirt, making them truly random. This is done by adding an extra variable to items, hence the savebreak. Any item that gets generated will have this variable set to a random number, but for now it's only relevant for shirts.

2.0.6 - September 2017
- Hanging up at a pending instadeath but before the game actually declares the player dead will instakill the player upon restoring.
- The #explore command can be used in wizard mode to switch to explore mode.
- Angel race characters with negative alignment record have aggravate monster.

2.0.5 - September 2017
- Fixed the "drop 0 gold pieces" segfault.
- Pets whose base level is 50 or higher, as well as those generated by jonadab's random monster perlscript, have an increased chance of turning traitor. Also, pets that turn traitor can now be frenzied sometimes.
- Fixed a bug where the addition of new terrain types caused certain interface screw traps to no longer work correctly.
- Fixed a bug where decontamination was too easy.
- Allow players wearing ski heels or certain artifacts to walk on snow more quickly.
- Dipping the book of the dead in lava doesn't erroneously say "the book burns up" when it really doesn't.
- Shoplifting or having a high sin counter can give a cop wanted level, which repeatedly causes kops to respawn for a while.
- Firing a bow, crossbow or sling at point blank is ineffective and does less damage than it would if the monster were standing farther away.
- Pets eating corpses or non-comestible food gain less nutrition than previously.
- Attacking a monster with the flickerer egotype using something that does no damage gives better messages, since players used to not realize they were doing no damage.
- Ranged weapons were nerfed in a number of ways, including a lowered chance to hit if the target is standing far away, a reduction of the damage bonuses given to the individual ammos, and allowing certain monsters (most notably ghosts, but also amorphous ones) to avoid projectiles with a certain chance. Firearms are exempt from most of those nerfs.
- When the player is on Fort Ludios, the dungeon depth is displayed.
- Certain actions that summon kops will now spawn kop cubes too.
- Dipping spellbooks into lava will burn them away completely.
- Finished functionality for the new special rooms and terrain types.

2.0.4 - August 2017
- Improved the handling of the obj_is_local error. The underlying cause was not found, but the odds of producing a corrupted savegame should be lower now.
- Added many new terrain types, dungeon features and special rooms that can be randomly generated over the course of the game.
- Better display of the gamemode string in the xlogfile entry.
- The message suppression trap suppresses any and all --More-- prompts as well.
- The previous message command cannot be used to "cheat" past certain interface screw trap effects.
- The #overview command does not work at all while the display loss trap is in effect.
- Stairdancing is limited: now, there's a chance that the player cannot use staircases for a couple of turns after taking one, forcing them to fight whichever monsters they were trying to cheese. Magic portals are also affected for the same reason.
- Monster-versus-monster calming attacks are no longer guaranteed to calm the defending monster.

2.0.3 - August 2017
- Fixed an error in the handling of the obj_is_local crash where the game would fail to save data to the savegame, corrupting it in the process.
- The summon undead spell no longer produces tame undead, and the command undead spell can sometimes create traps on the current dungeon level as a negative side effect, plus monsters are more resistant to the effect and can occasionally be frenzied instead.
- Items can be dipped into lava.
- Slightly improved player's melee to-hit rating, nerfed ranged weapon to-hit rating to be closer to the new melee values, and there's a 5% chance of a monster's AC being halved for any particular AC check, making them a little bit easier to hit (AC -30 monsters should not be completely impossible to hit unless you have uber items and stats).
- Contamination effects on HP/Pw regeneration depend on how contaminated you are.
- Added a couple of monster attacks, and the contamination effect that works similar to weeping angels from dnethack: it gradually saps the player's wisdom in a way that cannot be restored.

2.0.2 - August 2017
- Added a STUPIDRANDOMMONSTERBUG compile flag that is not defined by default, but can be turned on in case seemingly random things (e.g. monsters hitting with a poisoned attack) are causing the game to crash (seems to happen on certain Unices). It should *only* be turned on if those crashes are actually happening, since it turns off the randomized names of certain monsters.
- Tried to fix the scroll of copying segfault that happens on public servers, not sure if it works now.
- Monsters associated with brains can give +INT when eaten.
- Protection from shape changers works better and should not make 50% of all werefoo unkillable anymore.
- Monsters with M2_DOMESTIC or M3_PETTY flags are tameable, even if they'd otherwise be resistant to taming (e.g. due to being in the @ monster class).
- Increased the prices for certain magical types of shields.
- Angering the watchmen in town levels summons Keystone Kops.
- The "lag defense tower" monster causes artificial lag.
- Monsters with ranged attacks will not breathe while the player is in a wall, and if they fire a projectile it can now hit the player instead of stopping on the empty square in front of the wall.
- Chest and door traps can sometimes surround the player with more traps.
- Turning off the sparkle option no longer disables the lag trap's artificial lag effect.
- Overhauled the shop maze level by making sure all the shops can be reached without teleportation or digging.
- Cursed invocation tools still have a chance of working correctly on the vibrating square.
- Stoning and sliming should always give a message when they start.
- Hallucination provides 90% chance of not turning to stone when the player otherwise would.
- Fixed a bug where bumping into a door while under the hyperbluewall trap effect didn't damage the player.
- Scrolls, potions and spellbooks can train the device skill, and the latter benefit from it as well.
- Fixed a bug where monsters with litter gazes could affect the player even while not seen.
- Controlled lycanthropy prompts require a full yes/no answer.
- Using #technique while on the vibrating square gives a special message. This is meant as a way to find the vibrating square while under the effect of multiple interface screw trap effects, which is not all that likely but in the case that it does happen, the game should not be unwinnable by insanity.
- Certain traps that were supposed to be always visible were not. Fixed.
- Prevent an infinite loop if the game tries to spawn a monster on a level filled completely with monsters, by having it abort and print an error message if no suitable position was found after 100000 tries.
- Occasionally, newly spawned monsters might be in the player's field of view now even if positions outside of the player's LOS were available.
- Circumvent monsndx panic error by having the game default to spawning a PM_HUMAN.

2.0.1 - July 2017
- Set the default value for the popup_dialog option to true.
- Set the default interface to tty if both tty and curses are available.
- Fake artifacts are resistant to bad polymorphs and nymphs' item-stealing attacks.
- Armors with enchantment properties will not be deleted if they are a part of a monster's starting inventory and the monster is killed.
- Cancelled gremlins once again cannot steal intrinsics from the player.
- Increased the spawn chances for the different types of candles, and placed a bunch of various candles on Vlad's tower.
- Fixed the bug where the mail daemon would deliver gold pieces for minimalist race players.
- While standing on a pit but not actually trapped in it, the > key allows the player to descend into the pit.
- Quitting or escaping the dungeon early on prevents the game from getting on the high-score list.
- Quaffing lethe water now causes amnesia.
- Increased the starting HP for the erdrick role.
- Rodney's tower and the fake towers now spawn with random special rooms.
- Fungus farms and lemure pits spawn a wider range of monster types.
- Artifacts (both real and fake) never resist identification attempts, and are never deleted when they were in a monster's starting inventory. If a weapon or armor is randomly generated with a nonzero enchantment value, there's a significant chance that it gets made into a fake artifact.
- Implemented the #annotate and #overview commands.
- Using : while standing on a throne or altar tells the player how to interact with these dungeon features.
- Lightsabers can #force in > direction while lit to dig a hole.
- If the player is polymorphed into or riding a very fast (speed > 24) monster, their actual movement speed will be lower than the monster's nominal speed, depending on the polymorphing/riding skill.
- Dipping an item into a toilet can cause the toilet to break.
- The prompt when a nymph tries to steal a cursed item requires a yes/no answer.
- Failed wishes (usually when the player's luck is negative) can have a variety of nasty effects.
- The cmdassist message tells the player how to switch between vikeys and number pad.
- If the player reads a scroll of symmetry, the quicktravel command is deactivated.
- Changed generation chances for certain weapons, most notably making firearms and their ammo more common, and long swords are no longer more common than short swords.
- Fix the segfault caused by cutting a long worm in two when it only had 1 HP or long worms were genocided.
- Items whose weight is specified as zero in objects.c weigh 16 times less (they used to weigh a half weight unit).
- Prostitutes can have sex with the player, and their maledictions can cause the dim status effect.
- Jonadab's Heavyload was incorrectly not flagged as an evil artifact.
- The god-o-meter can also work while not blessed.
- If an artifact is overenchanted and would normally evaporate, it becomes +0 instead.
- Added a bunch of dungeon level variants from GruntHack and NetHack Fourk, and harder versions of the dnethack demon lairs.

2.0.0 - June 2017
- A player character causing conflict will be significantly more likely to get hit by monster attacks, which has the effect of changing it from its previous "generally a boon, unless you have pets" implementation to the two-edged sword it should always have been.
- Blessed scrolls of remove curse are no longer guaranteed to uncurse everything in the player's main inventory; non-equipped items have a chance to resist. Also, full-inventory identify effects have lower odds per item to reveal stuff.
- Casting the air current spell gives a luck penalty if done in Sokoban.
- Reduced speed of the Deadly Sins to 11, and prevented them from leaving death drops to make them harder to farm in case anyone is lame enough to actually attempt that.
- Fixed an error where certain nasty traps were behaving incorrectly with the curses interface.
- Fixed a fatal error where branch staircases or magic portals could fail to be placed if the game tried to make them on a terrain type that wasn't open floor.
- Blind monsters, which were supposed to be immune to conflict, would still wander randomly (as opposed to making a beeline to the player character to attack) when a player was causing conflict. This has been corrected.
- Improved the nexus field, tunnelization, grow trees and geolysis spells.
- Fawn, satre and sticker race player characters will train the device skill more quickly than others.
- Stepping on the vibrating square will light it, and the status message will tell the player they're standing on it.
- Added a message when the player zaps a wand of inertia control.
- If the player has the petkeeping skill, it's possible to take pets along to other levels even if they're not adjacent. The higher the skill, the greater the radius. And because skills shouldn't ever have drawbacks when increased, there is a y/n prompt so the player won't have to go out of their way to ditch unwanted pets while having high skill levels.
- The sudden/unfair attack traps were doing nothing due to an oversight, which has been fixed.
- Paralysis is shown in the bottom status line.
- Blessed destroy armor scrolls prompt the player to choose the item that can be destroyed.
- Sink quaffing could cause error messages if the effect was a random potion and the game failed to make one.
- Nurse halls and beehives spawn a greater variety of monsters.
- Fixed the autoopendoors patch not interacting correctly with certain nasty traps.
- The polyinitor race has a better chance of getting a form with weapon attacks.
- Special rooms can occasionally be generated with aggravate monster rules, producing monsters that are possibly out of depth.
- Terrain-altering scrolls have lesser effects on Sokoban levels, to reduce the odds of the levels becoming nearly impossible to complete.
- Hunger level has a lesser effect on attribute training.
- Foocubus seduction has a full yes/no prompt; it was too easy to spacebar past it in the heat of combat and give an answer you didn't intend to give.
- At this point, the autoopendoors patch was implemented.
- Increased the chance of "odd" tension rooms, that is, ones where the monster selection isn't based on a specific glyph but a specific color or other random trait.
- Being zapped by a monster's wand of cancellation interrupts the player.
- The #invoke command will also suggest fake artifacts as valid choices.
- The player's summoning spells (create monster, summon undead) don't produce higher level monsters if the player has aggravate monster.
- Hostile whores have better to-hit against the player.
- Cursed lizards were abusable. Closed the loophole.
- Wishing for an object has a small chance of giving the player amnesia.
- Added a variety of warning messages in case the player is bashing with a launcher or polearm.
- Eating any mimic corpse just causes the player to mimic gold or an orange for a random time.
- Very rarely, boss monsters can be generated to "avenge" other monsters the player has killed.
- The player cannot easily uncurse their items by using pools of lethe water; they will still unbless items though.
- Fixed a ton of stuff to make the curses interface work correctly. Also added a "moreforced" option that can be disabled to turn off any predefined --More-- prompts, and made the brain-ruptured (sorry) tab confirmation in curses mode into a "tabcursesconfirm" option that defaults to off. This is because the message telling the player to press tab will not always be displayed for some reason, and we don't want players to think their game died - default behavior should always be "spacebar clears away any and all messages"!
- The curses interface was added at this point.
- Fixed the garbage strings on Unix. The flicker strip trap in particular exposed that they had huge problems.
- Fixed a bug where monsters with gaze-based item stealing attacks wouldn't check whether the player can actually see them.
- Fixed some artifacts' special attacks never triggering even though they should.
- Fixed a formatting error with erosionproof item names.
- Greatly reduced the chance of the bell of opening actually opening locked doors and iron chains, since it has many more charges now and we don't want those special effects to be too easily obtainable.
- While under the effect of a knowledge trap, the player will no longer get a confirmation when trying to step on a known trap.
- No robes will give spellcasting penalties, not even the robe of weakness.
- Added the Prostitute and Kurwa roles.

1.9.8 - May 2017
- A player polymorphed into a monster with spellcasting attacks has better spellcasting success chances.
- Fixed the bug where triggering a map amnesia trap wouldn't immediately refresh the screen.
- Monsters in IVAN vaults always generate with aggravate monster rules.
- Demons summoned from same-race sacrificing can be princes now, and have a very minuscule chance of being tame.
- Fixed some fallthrough bugs that caused certain characters to have the wrong starting inventory or alignment record.
- If a nymph tries to steal the player's weapon and fails, the game correctly says "weapon" now.
- Banned grid bug players and players who triggered the bishop trap from using autotravel, since it could be used to bypass the movement restrictions in certain cases.
- Fixed an off-by-one error when creating irregular rooms, which would occasionally result in such rooms being generated without walkable floor tiles and causing a panic.
- Peacevision highlights monsters with a "peaceful" green color now, as opposed to the hostile-looking orange one we had earlier.
- Beefed up skill cap drain and nastiness monster attacks by making their special effects proc more often.
- Gave scrolls of root password detection to all the new demon lords.
- If the player polymorphs one of the riders, or also if they self-polymorph for any reason, a new rider is generated somewhere on the level. This is because it's possible to get rid of them permanently by turning the polymorphed rider to stone.

1.9.7 - May 2017
- Improved some of the timer-related error messages.
- Dipping an item that can rust into a pool of water can result in destroying it if it gets rusty enough.
- Fixed a bug where the fast metabolism trap effect could result in the player dying instantly.
- Added a "scentful perfume" attack that can be used by monsters.

1.9.5 - May 2017
- If a monster steals an item from the player, there is no longer a random chance of deleting the item. This was meant to be a fix for a segfault but in reality that segfault was caused by hallucinated objects and got fixed in version 2.0.7. Since it was stupid that your gear could just randomly be erased by nymphs, I didn't put this feature back into the game.
- Changed some timer-related error messages to reduce the odds of crashing while trying to display the error message.
- Added new playable races: destabilizer, green slime, loli and polyinitor.
- Wild talents can now learn random techniques when they level up.
- Added a new technique: panic digging, which is available to all characters and digs out the eight surrounding squares, for use in situations where there is no way forward and the player has no other means of digging.
- Artifacts that do extra damage do random bonus damage now. This includes ones that deal "double damage".

1.9.4 - April 2017
- At the start of the game, some monster traits will be picked that are more common in that particular game.
- Deactivated intrinsics were displayed incorrectly in the enlightenment screen. Fixed.
- Changed the peacevision highlighting color to green, and made it so that stairs obscured by monsters, traps or other stuff will be highlighted (they used to be highlighted only when obscured by an item).
- Fixed a segfault that could occur when engraving with a wand of tele level.
- Improved the "ascension kits" given to player monsters on the Astral Plane. They have a good chance of receiving artifact armor now.
- Increased the amount of charges for the Bell of Opening.
- Map amnesia now periodically redraws the screen.
- The YSexymate role starts with a weaker pet now.
- The teamsplat cloak now works correctly even if LIVELOGFILE is not defined.
- The dumplog file now shows information about the game version.
- Fixed a bug where heavy caster cloaks would trash the player's spellcasting chances more than they should.
- Low-level characters get a small to-hit bonus to make the early game less deadly.

1.9.3 - March 2017
- Altars no longer disappear randomly when dropping an item whose BUC status is already known. They also don't disappear randomly when dropping potions of water or doing a water prayer.
- Fixed the bug where centaur and dryad races didn't get the phase door technique.
- Fixed the quirky formula that would increase the Riders' and Seven Deadly Sins' HP when they resurrect.
- The mazke and aureal races are weaker if the player's gender is male.
- Librarians deal extra damage when bashing with a spellbook, depending on the remaining amount of charges.
- The "Greneuvenia's Hug" artifact pair of boots' negative effect can no longer be nullified via MSGTYPE settings.
- Some random levels that could appear very early had no guaranteed path between the staircases, this has been corrected since it's stupid if the player has to hope for a random dwarf with a pick-axe to spawn.
- Fixed some bug with turbo boots.
- Burning fern spores were too strong and therefore got nerfed.
- The player can now put on a shirt or torso armor without having to take off other pieces first. It is now also possible to put on gloves or rings while wielding cursed weapons.
- When trying to loot something while polymorphed into a form without hands, the player no longer incorrectly gets double the intended risk of a bad effect.
- Polymorphing skill allows the player to sometimes keep wearing their stuff even when polymorphing into something that would be unable to wear them. The player can still decide to drop the items anyway.
- Improved the algorithm that randomly selects traps.
- Murderer role now gets messages upon leveling up.
- Tried once again to fix the savegame error.
- Improved the algorithm for randomizing the player's starting equipment.
- Gremlins no longer leave corpses because farming is just so lame.
- Item materials can be randomized at the start of the game.
- When using a scroll of proof armor, the proofed piece of armor now shows its erosionproof status.
- Fixed the message spam that would occur when using the travelto command.
- Albae monsters no longer spawn with bows, because they were too strong.
- When the player has aggravate monster, the maximum monster level doesn't get randomly decreased.

1.9.2 - March 2017
- The undefined race no longer has the scrolls of healing, mana etc. replaced with random other scroll types.
- Allowed hybrid races to be set directly via the options file.
- Taking a staircase can push the player back, especially in conjunction with stair traps, to make it harder to escape them or otherwise do stairdancing.
- Free action, like most other resistances do already, now also has a chance to fail.
- Fixed a potential segfault that could happen when trying to display the name of the player's deities as a heretic wild talent.

1.9.1 - February 2017
- Fixed a bug that would suppress water/lava paranoid messages when playing as the amnesiac race and cause players to fall in with no warning.
- When trying to cast a spell while confused, the player now prints a message to make it clear to the player that they're trying something that is likely to fail.
- When walking into a wall, tree, set of iron bars etc., there is now a message. (Players who bitch about that can use MSGTYPE to suppress them.)
- Got rid of the mtrapseen field, since it didn't really make sense that if a monster knew about one pit trap, it would mysteriously know about all other pit traps in the entire dungeon. The real reason was that it would cause the variable to overflow due to the large amount of traps in the game, and thus, since it's not really needed due to the aforementioned weirdness, it has been removed; monsters just have a random chance of avoiding traps instead now.

1.9.0 - February 2017
- Monsters affected by certain harmful potions now display messages in the correct order. This doubles as protection against potential segfaults.
- Added four new playable roles: Wild Talent, Occult Master, Elementalist, Chaos Sorceror.

1.8.9 - February 2017
- Fixed an oversight that caused restore ability spell failures to not have the intended effect.
- Added an extra warning message if a spell known by the player is down to 1% memory, and a message when the spell is completely forgotten.
- Replaced the spaghetti function that selects traps for weird-looking rooms with a better function.
- Aggravate monster will randomly spawn out of depth monsters around the player, and also allows summoned monsters to be out of depth sometimes.
- Fixed a segfault that could occur when changing levels.
- Tried to fix a segfault that could happen when loading a bones level on which the previous player had died with a lit lightsaber; it turned out that this commit didn't really fix the core problem.
- Added some bullshit for soviet mode.
- When playing the inka race, amulets and rings can be taken off normally even when they're made of elasthan, and wands made of it will train the device skill more quickly.
- Added a map amnesia attack that monsters can use.
- Chaotic minions summoned by angry gods can be any demons, and are no longer limited to the & glyph.
- Maledictions uttered by Rodney, angels and the like always have a chance of dimming the player.

1.8.7 - January 2017
- Removed out of depth high priests from certain dungeon levels.
- Added the dimness status condition and the peacevision in/extrinsic.
- Added a bunch of new materials for items.

1.8.6 - December 2016
- The thunder wave spell no longer erroneously affects all monsters on the current dungeon level, but only the ones next to the player.
- Enlightenment shows special game modes like lost soul or hippie.
- Fixed an error that could cause vibrating squares to spawn in Sheol.
- The penultimate Sheol level was ineligible to leave bones due to a bug, this has been corrected.
- All levels on Vlad's tower prevent wallwalking.
- Sea elves aren't affected by water turbulences while underwater.
- "The Rest of Hypnos" sleep megaspell works correctly now.
- Improved the rate at which body armor and general combat skills train.
- Added a #twiz command for wizard mode, which sets the timeout on all techniques to zero.
- Fixed a bug where stealing a monster's wielded weapon could result in errors.
- The #mark command no longer works on unpaid shop items.
- Fixed a bug where monsters with passive stealing attacks could cause a segfault if their attack triggered after the monster had already been killed.
- Sacrificing a crossaligned unicorn to the own deity now improves maximum alignment record.
- Certain techniques that used to have no timeout after using now have one.
- Reading a scroll of resistance no longer segfaults.
- (Almost) All damage types do something when the attack type is "explosion", and this includes polymorphed players exploding at monsters as well as monsters exploding at other monsters.
- In each game, there is one property that the player cannot have at all, one that the player cannot have as an intrinsic, and one that the player cannot have as an extrinsic, selected randomly.

1.8.5 - December 2016
- Fixed an error caused by monsters trying to cast a spell type that has no defined effect.
- Clones of the player's nemesis have a much higher chance to spawn randomly.
- Added a #mark command that can be used on items to make pets not drop them.
- Lowered the effect of constitution on the player's health regeneration rate.
- The supermarket cashier role is now good at using tin openers in melee. They also benefit from some of the martial arts techniques.
- Added an effect that creates a bad artifact, removes whatever the player is wearing in the slot that will be occupied by it, force-equips the generated bad artifact and curses it.
- Tool shopkeepers can now recharge lamps.
- The player can cast their role-specific special spell for a lowered mana cost.
- Erosionproofing an item now protects it against certain effects on which it had no effect before.
- If the player has the two-weapon combat skill, it will always be shown in the list - it used to be not shown if the player was in a form that's not able to use it, which made no sense.
- The random chance of equipment dulling and losing enchantment is now lowered if the player improves the relevant skill (general combat for weapons, body armor for armor pieces).
- If a demon "casts aspersions on your ancestry", there is now an actual random message, specifically a "your momma" joke, being displayed randomly.
- Gray stones and gems can spawn in larger stacks.
- If the player applied nail polish and is wearing fingerless gloves, the unarmed damage bonus will apply.

1.3.1 - August 2015
- Tried to seal the segfaults that happen with monsters that have the %s string in their name.

- Moved the showdmg message after the actual HP reduction to make it harder for players to hangup cheat the damage away.
- If the player is about to enter a lava tile or attack a peaceful monster, hitting y will give an extra yes/no prompt.
